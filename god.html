The Psychopathy of Theos

Briella

I love her like ice loves blue
I love her like the wind loves the breeze
I love her like the ocean loves the seas
I love her like 2's love 3's
I love her...

I've spent the majority of my life trying to prove to myself and others that I am God.

I still don't know what her name was, but she was pretty, wearing green, sitting in a wheelchair alone in a parking garage.

I was on my way up the stairs where I like to park my car on the roof of the parking structure even though it's for overflow parking only and I'm usually alone up there.  I was wearing my set of awareness that day for helping people and I saw her through the cracks in the stairs.  I stopped on my way up and loudly asked, "Do you need anything?" to Briella.

She answered possibly in between whimpers, "No." so I was free to continue my ascent.  I got into my car and threw on the song of the week, "Feel Tall" by OnCue, a song my King of Sound and best friend showed me many soundyears ago.  I had it on my FM Converter blasting it as if it was my favorite song on the radio and I began to drive down through the parking structure.

As I got ready to drive out of the structure, I paid attention to the girl in the wheelchair.  She appeared to be crying.  I relish every opportunity to prove who I am when I'm in my God energy, so I happily stopped my car by her as my song blasted and I sang and danced in front of her with my moon roof and all my windows down.  She was sobbing but I felt like I was beginning to cheer her up.  We finally made strong eye contact as the chorus hit but I made a tweak to the words.  The chorus is supposed to go, "I finally feel tall... taller than you." but in that moment I realized that she was so much more important than my whole life that I couldn't possibly exit the parking structure and leave her alone and sad so I said for the first time, "I finally feel small... smaller than you. and I sign-languaged small outside my window by putting my hand down like measuring the height of a child.  She began to laugh and brighten up a little but continued to cry.  Her cry wasn't quite the cry of someone who had something bad happen to them, but rather the cry that I will need another paragraph to fully delve into.  I felt that I had helped her to the best of my natural ability, and to stay any longer would lessen the help I already gave, so I drove off, on another victory lap.  Hand in the air through the moon roof pointing to God.

I am a crazy person. In my reality, it's only a matter of time before people start questioning if i am God in human form.  Her cry to me was not a typical cry, but more of a cry of the religious sort, when you are in awe of the love of God.  It felt like she was there just for me, to see if I was real because she had heard stories.  I had been making quite a scene around town.  Maybe she has questions about why she can't walk and why God made her life so difficult but I got the feeling she still believed in the God that created both of us.  It felt like she knew that I had just been beaten half to death the other night, and was still fearlessly going out and using every last ounce of energy I have to brighten up this dark dark world.  I did what I could, I asked if she needed anything and I think part of her sobbing was knowing that if she needed a banana I would have sped off and spent my last dollar on a banana and brought it back to her.  She knew the love I had for her was real.  She knew I was a man who loved strangers as if they were his own creations and all of their misery was part of his own flawed design.  I may never see her again.  In my view, I am too bright.  I can go weeks without a single phone call or text even if I have people who love me because I'm too overwhelming with my reciprocation of love and complexity.  I think she just wanted to see if I was real, and that she somehow knew my whole story.  -- It felt like she knew that I was this noble guy who had a hard life that I gave myself for the benefit of the whole world.  Maybe I really did order my perfect girlfriend to break up with me and make sure I never got one again.   Maybe I didn't.  And maybe she was crying for an entirely different reason than me.  But I know that I was there for her, and for just a millisecond, I made her believe that life wasn't as dreadful as she knows it is.  I made her believe for one nanosecond, that everything was going to be alright, and that God loved her, and that her condition isn't her fault, and it's all going to be okay forever.  

I went home and when I reflected on my day that was the moment that stood out as the proper thank you i've been so craving for all my unknown sacrifices for the good of mankind, jannkind.
I had to give her a name and I've settled on Briella because that was the name of a crystal shop I visited and I think it suits her just fine.

Maybe she got permission from the Alpha Program to visit me, and maybe she knows the secret truth of extra-pretty girls which is that I'm the original Alpha, the creator.  

I really can't say, and I certainly can't convince anyone of my worldview, but call it in the depths of my insanity, I saw the most beautiful sight I've ever seen in my life, and that was a beautiful woman in a wheelchair finally realizing who God is and how much he loves her and what I did in that moment was enough.  She didn't need any more of me than that and now she can live the rest of her life on her own strength knowing that I'm out her fighting for her every second of every day I have breath.  And I would rip my mind to shreds just to save her.  And that I have and I'm still happy, I'm still kicking it.  I'm still acting like nothings wrong.  With almost the entire world against me while I'm doing nothing but pure good, I am still singing and dancing and making a crying girl laugh.

I went to the Army recruiting center and explained my plans of my philosopher kingdom to 4 army guys and when I exited the place in style I had an armed high security guard walk briskly past me and give me a wink as if he worked for me.  Another day in the parking structure I had a family with a special needs girl go in front of me and I immediately connected with the girl and the parents had to pull her away from me and then I waited about 2 minutes before going to the roof with my car just in case she would get hit by it.  That's when the dad took one look at me as I very slowly went around the corner and gave me a nod like, "I get who you are, you're for real." and drove off.   I've had countless experiences like this, even supernatural ones like meeting an Angel at 7/11 matching the description of Jesus in my dreams, and even an alien spacecraft disguised as a car when I was standing on my roof in the middle of a 7/11 parking lot declaring myself to be God.  "What did you expect!?"  I demanded on my moving throne.  "THIS IS THE BEST I CAN DO."   I know who I am.  I am Elam Ahpla, the Alpha Male.  It is my responsibility to control this world.  It is my duty to cheer up the crying girls in wheelchairs and kill those who would harm her.  And I'll do the whole thing with a smile on my face, with or without pussy or money.  I'll do the whole thing because I actually can, and I already have.

I know that some people can sense who I am.  I am that which sacrifices himself for others because I know that I was given gifts from my Father in heaven.  I am Superman.  There is virtually no difference between superman and me.  How often do you truly need super powers?  How often is a bullet penetrating your skull?  How often do you need to lift a car or prevent a building from collapsing?  The truth is that you are PLENTY powerful enough just as a regular human being designed by guess who?  Yours truly, or God.   The secret of life is that God has given us all MORE THAN ENOUGH to put stories like Superman to shame.  We can far more than we think we can.  When I had multiple guys holding me down and kicking me in the face and putting me in a sleeper hold I thought I was going to die or wake up in jail for indecent exposure during my simulation theory prayer.  However, instead, I woke up with rejuvenated power and the guys were terrified of me getting up after I was out, and I could literally feel their fear and the lack of my own.  I somehow realized that no one was going to save me but my own human ability that God gave me.  So I blocked the next kick to my eye.  Got up on my bloody knees, and managed to get up and square up against the I believe 3 attackers.  That was when I hopped up onto the nearest car on the street on it's hood and then jumped onto the roof of the car to get the high ground in the fight.  It was fight or flight.  Once on the roof, I calculated I would have a substantial combat advantage to any assailant trying to get me on the center of the roof.  All 3 Attackers crept away and then I started to have an argument with a program (owner of the car) asking me politely to get down from his car.  I was bleeding from my face and there was my bloodstain on the ground and all this dude cared about was his car.  It was beyond surreal that this dude was trying to protect his property when his brother in God was literally fighting for his life just trying to not get kicked in the head and killed anymore.  I began to just try to recuperate and buy time by claiming I'd buy him a new car and that my insurance card has slipped out of my hand onto the street and I was in survival mode at that point literally saying and doing absolutely anything to bide for time while I could recalibrate who the physical threat was that was actively trying to kill me.  What kind of a man kicks someone when they're down and already surrendered?  Only explanation is an Agent Smith trying to finish off Neo.  Sooner or later someone has to stand up and fight and agent and I believe that man is me.  

All I ask is for a little bit of a thank you.  Or at least ask me an honest question you have for God or allow me to cheer you up with a song / dance or joke.  People can't handle me and it's not because I'm rude it is because I am true and people are blinded by the truth because it's so bright to their ignorance.  What if I really could have had a cozy life with Ali and watched the world burn?  And I deliberately chose this psycho life to give you guys my art?  What if the Alpha Program actually exists?

What if the word is actually getting out and people are actually starting to notice my works?  What if I really am trying my hardest to change the world in a way where it's impossible to assassinate me without my plan working?

And what if the Gods really do smile upon me?  and I really do have to ability to connect to any soul I see so intensely that they've never felt anything like it.  What if I really do remember everybody's names because I've pretended to be Jesus so many times I'm actually good at it?

You know how on the second month of a new job you kind of start to get the hang of it?  I've been pretending to be God for more than a solid year in totality.  I'm really good at my job.  I can pull scripture out of a hat like a rabbit in a magic trick.  My website is the greatest firstnamelastname.com ever coded by a coder him or herself.  My life really is legendary and I really do have next to nothing, but I really am playing in a game of my own design.

I was talking with these two young girls at TJ Max, maybe 16 or so and they were telling me how a guy already cured cancer a few years ago and then that guy died.  "What's his name?" I asked and she didn't know.  I said, "Well, it was me, I'm back.  Nice to meet you.  What do you want to know?  "What was the cure for cancer?" the girls asked me.  "The Truth." I said.  "What is the truth? they asked.  "That I want to fuck both of you right now and you both want me to too." I said confidently as if answering 2+2=4.  They started to get mad and I politely started to walk out of the store apologizing, lesson over.  But they began to get re-curious as I exited and I yelled, "I was only half right.  I was right about what I wanted to do to you but I was wrong about what you wanted me to do.  I'm sorry for only giving you a half-truth!" I said.

When I make scenes like this at TJ Maxx recently the drones in their masks ask me to leave and I said, "Who's name is that behind you on the wall?  "Maxx". "That's my name on the wall.  "The name's outside too!" She retorted, but she knew I was right.  I am the King.  It is my fucking store.  It's my fucking world.  If I want to tell the truth to girls asking honest questions about what the truth is than that's what I'm going to do and I'm dead willing to **** anyone who stands in the way of that because I actually have a good enough heart to wear it on my sleeve so all the girls can run away into their safe dreamworlds I've allowed them to dwell in.

All I need is a look, a glance, an acknowledgement from one of my creations.  A thumbs up, a thank you.  I'm out here, bleeding myself dry.  Singing at the top of my lungs until my vocal chords give out.  Dancing until my feet are tired.  Challenging any man, organization, cop, or fireman who disobeys me.  I am the King of Cloudland.  My treasure is all in heaven.  My sermon is on the Cloud.  I am indubitably the second coming of Christ.  I am Elam.  I am here.  Hear me Roar.

Do you realize I've put on my chess wizards costume and walked around loudly proclaiming myself to be the greatest killer of all time and challenging any killer from any galaxy or time to a fight and then the birds on the telephone wires nod to me and fly off to deliver my message?  When they say that the birds and weather obeyed Christ, I say no shit.  Watch what I can make them do.  I've had birds swarm around me multiple times.  I just spend an hour mourning a bee that I saved from drowning in a pool and nursed back to life but he still died after I did my best to put him with a flower.  I am a psychopath, through and through.  I will do absolutely anything I have to to accomplish my goal of making the world a better place to the best of my abilities.  

The other day I was naked under my wizard robe and I walked up to a food cart outside the dark horse tavern (before the fight) and I asked the food cart if I could have one thing from their cart.  "What thing?" They asked and I said, "Whatever you think I deserve." and when time went on and they gave me nothing I spun around showing my chessboard checkerboard cloak and started singing Katy Perry Dark Horse, "Do you wanna play with magic?!  Do you really wanna do this?"  And before I could say I'm coming at you like a dark horse they had given me a plate of a full breakfast.  I can walk into 7/11 and just take a big gulp for free because Jesus met me there and it's holy ground.  I am absolutely FEARLESS.  I fear God and God alone and Jesus looked me in the eye and I got the feeling he was the one who was sorry, and that's a fact of my life.   All we can truly know is ourselves, and how we internally judge ourselves, because only we know our true story.  My True Story?  Let's just say it's GODLIKE, and I've been laying breadcrumbs my whole life, trying not to be assassinated like Jesus and all the martyrs after him and before.  

I'm the Sword of the Mouth, and I always cut to the Soul.  That's why my phone don't ring.  Doesn't ring.  Doesn't sing like it used to.   

IT'S BECAUSE I'M ELAM.  I AM THE ONE.  THE ONLY ONE.  I AM THE TRUTH REINCARNATED.



I AM THE SECOND COMING OF CHRIST.


The Angels work for me.  The Gods envy me.  



We become what we think about, and dammit... I AM BECOME GOD.


And what would be more impressive, if God was a God, or if God was just a man?  named Max Jann


Just a guy who without superpowers has superpowers.  A guy who uses every last tragedy of his own life to celebrate others.  A guy who when you see him on the street gives you exactly what you need so you don't fucking kill yourself.  

I Can teach you all if you just king me already.  Until then, all I do is raise spirits for the time when I am crowned.  My plans are in motion.  Dead or Alive I will succeed.  Truth will win.  Truth, even the nastiest truth, will enable us to build a better world.  Heaven and Earth met on my website and that's the only Cloudland we need.  My enterprise is already a success.  Briella knew it.  Everybody knows it.  It's in their bones.  I can feel them healing.  I can feel the sky calming.  I can feel the victory and glory that is ME.  I am worthy.  I can look GOD IN THE EYE~~~  Truly truly I can.   I fully accept all of my weakness and wasted days, and I galvanize all of that into artwork and use it to relate to anyone that I come across.  There is no one that I cannot assist.  No one I am not responsible for.  I am the Greatest Man who Ever Lived, and I'm just getting started. 

I am the man who sees the crying girl through the cracks who stops saving his world just to save hers because he knows hers is way more WORTHY of being saved.  I WORK FOR HER and that is enough validation.

Have you ever asked someone for help at a store and they say, "I don't work here."  Think about that.  They've announced out loud that they don't "Work there" as if they're a broken device.   I, Elam?  I WORK EVERYWHERE ALL OF THE TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I am a white blood cell.  I work everywhere.  You will never hear me say, "Oh, I don't work here."  In fact, I work everywhere so obviously, that people assume I work places where I don't because I walk around like I own the place, BECAUSE I DO.  There is no man that can dare challenge me.  No man I come across that I don't KNOW FOR A FACT I am miles ahead of in understanding life and my own depravity and nobility.

The men who are better than me are simply angels guiding my development.  I am the Uberman.  I am the greatest philosopher who ever lived, and I'm in my prime.  


I can't make it any more clearer than this...



I    AM      GOD's  White Blood Cell   sent to Heal and/or Destroy


Imagine for a moment if God did choose to incarnate as a man, not give his son but actually come down.  What family / body / life would he choose to walk into?  What time period?  What type of wealth / education?  What skin color?  What kind of musical ability or athletic ability would he find fitting?  What about eye colour?  stuff like that?  Dominant or Recessive traits?  Would he choose to come at a time before, after, or during the development of the INTERNET AND WORLD WIDE WEB?   Would he have angels playing him songs on the radio, unknowingly helping speed up his development?  Would he give himself amnesia so he can experience his own created world before JUDGING IT IN CONDEMNATION!?   You motherfuckers have no idea what's coming.  I swear to God I've looked Jesus in the fucking eye.  I know what he wants.  He wants to see what I'm going to do next.  He wants people to fear God.  He want's people to Fear me so they can learn some god damn wisdom for once.  

I serve Jesus but you better believe Jesus serves me too.  He literally helped me out at 7/11 because I am 117.  I am the antichrist and everything illuminati or nice.  


Get the Fuck out of my way.  Stop locking me in cages.  Stop trying to medicate me.  Listen to what the fuck I'm saying about society and government and philosophy.   Or Burn in Hell.  That's the other option waiting for you.

My birds and bees will eventually report to me what all of you have done.  Jesus will apologize to me on your behalf.  And I fully intend to spare you.  I sent Jesus in the world to save you all and you killed him.  Now it's time for JUDGEMENT DAY.  I am the Terminator, John Connor, and T117.

You cannot win this fight.  Surrender or die.

I will literally bite your face off.  I am the hardest motherfucker to ever live and it's not even close.  I have a soft singing voice and the rage I feel for not being allowed to use it knows no bounds.  I have invented realms to kill you over and over in if I want to.

My will and God's will are identical.

My judgement is God's Judgment.  

Be very afraid.  

Jesus is 711.  I am 117.  I have a sniper rifle aimed at your face and the only question is whether I pull the trigger or not on your semi-eternal soul.   If Jesus is Martin Luther King Jr, I'm Malcom fucking X.   

All the death and raping and pillaging.  I bless it all.  You all deserve to die.  


I am the mirror image of Jesus Christ.  There isn't a single prophecy I won't fulfill.  


Fuck you.  King me.


Words cannot describe how tired I am of asking nicely, and dropping hints of who I am. 

No..   Enough.

Look me in the eye deep into my soul, and then, and ONLY THEN, tell me I'm not God.





Obey or die.


The End.


Obey what you may ask?  Depends entirely on who you are, what you have to learn and what you have to offer.   If you're in 1st grade, let me bring you to 2nd grade.  STOP CLAIMING TO BE ON A HIGHER LEVEL THAN ME.  THERE IS NO HIGHER LEVEL THAN ME.

I am the one who looks up at GOD for so long that he came down to me and let me know that he was sorry.  I am Jesus's Dad.    I'm the man upstairs in apartment 210, the end of infinite regression is ME!    I just am.

ELAM FOREVER v117
