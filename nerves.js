                    This is a post for someone who believes in the general consensus of how the world works, but is open to information that challenges their world view.  
                </p>
                <p>I've included a video of chapter 1 of a book for the conspiracy noobie.  Someone who knows something isn't quite right with the fact that we went to the moon 52 years ago and haven't gone since.  All the computer stuff that happened?  Who needs that!  Maybe someone who thinks Lee Harvey Oswald didn't singlehandedly take down the president with a magic bullet as he conveniently drove by his place of work in a convertable and no one used the upper floors.</p>
                <p>Maybe they find it hard to believe that 6 guys with box cutters hijacked planes and managed to strike the Pentagon, and the twin towers while all the fighter jets were confused by the hijacking training excersise scheduled for that day.</p>
                <p>Maybe they're wondering why the buildings collapsed suddenly at near free fall speed as if it was a controlled demolition when the only damage was in the upper floors.</p>
                <p>
                    I guess if anyone could find this useful it would be a young person, maybe 18, who isn't entreched in his world view yet.  
                </p>
                <p>If you think it's the Rebuplicans vs. Democrats and we live in a democracy by the people and for the people then this isn't for you.  If, on the other hand, you've noticed that no matter who gets elected, the government pulls the same shit then maybe you're open to learning about why.  I view these things as kindergarden level because I've been doing this for a decade, but you have to start somewhere.</p>
                <p>The amazing chasm between someone in the know and someone not in the know is so incredibly large and uncrossable that I'm not sure what to do.  It's supernatural how difficult it is to explain to someone basically anything that goes against what the news presents as real. </p>
                <p>
                    I see young healthy people in their car with their mask on alone.  How much more brainwashed could you possibly be?  
                </p>
                <p>
                    And here's the creepiest part.  There is a recent Mandela Effect where Selma Hayek's name has changed to Salma Hayek and has always been Salma.  I knew my Dad was a fan of Selma Hayek and thought she was pretty, so I called him up.  "Dad, what's the name of that actress who's last name is hayek?"  "Selma!  Selma Hayek" He says.  Then I ask him, "Could you spell it for me please"  "S-E-L-M-A"  I say, "Ok, for a brand new car in this game show, is that your final answer?" "Yes."  "Okay, google it.  Gotta go!"
                </p>
                <p>
                    After googling it and seeing that her name is now and always has been "Salma" which sounds ugly, first of all, after seeing that he texts me basically saying, "Oops, and I should know that because I just pitched her a screenplay."  So not only is he a fan, he's practically a collegue, and it didn't even cross his mind to use an A instead of an E when a car was on the line.  Now after a quick google, he's 100% sure he was mistaken because obviously google has it correct.
                </p>
                <p>Yes they do, and her name has always been Salma.  But here's where it gets really creepy.  We argue about it for a while and by the end of it he texts me.  "I love it.  I love the spelling with the A.  It's beautiful."  So that's what we're dealing with.  Not only will people completely disregard their own memory and immediately take the google download of information, but they love it!  That's what we're dealing with.  He wasn't even bothered by his misspelling of it within a few hours.  He actually prefers the information spoonfed to him as opposed to having his own opinion.  Granted it's a tall order to remodel your reality model based on one celebrity's name but to love it and call it beautiful when it's actually an ugly ass name that sticks out like a sore thumb and you would have been out a brand new car if you were on a real game show?  To love it just creeps me the fuck out, it really does.  It reminds me of Winston loving Big Brother by the end of 1984.  </p>
                <p>Now, I love my Dad and I don't care that he doesn't accept the Mandela Effect.  Whatever.  There are more important things in life that he knows way more about than me but I wanted to share that creepy story to let you know what we're up against.  </p>
                <p>
                    You don't need to be a structual engineer or a demolition expert to know that the twin towers didn't fall because of a pancake effect from the top floor giving out due to a fire.  You just need common sense.  I don't know what's going on here.  It's like some weird trick of the Devil.  It's virtually impossible to explain to someone the simplest little thing that contracticts their version of reality.  In Fairness the Bible does say that the Devil deceiveth the whole world and that you will be persecuted for following the path of Christ but I just never imagined it would be like this.  It's like I'm speaking a different language!  
                </p>
                <p>
                    This post is for no one!  There is NO ONE.  You can call me crazy but at least I know to go for the bottom jenga block to make it collapse.  Good luck pulling from the second from the top and hoping a pancake effect collapses the whole thing.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    So how do I know I'm not crazy?  I don't know.  I can checkmate you with my eyes closed or drop a nuke on you in call of duty.  I can get a college degree and a coding dojo certificate and code this whole website.  I've been crazy before.  I went full on crazy for like a month, but even then, at my worst, I still had more truth in me than the average zombie who thinks our response to covid 19 is perfectly reasonable.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's probably not even possible to study all this stuff without going crazy.  I don't think I get enough credit for trying.  Sure, I lost it for a couple weeks but that's what this shit can do to you.  When you realize everything is a lie why not question whether you really need sleep?  Which is what I did to cause my poor judgement during that period of time.  But who cares?  I go crazy for a month during 10 years of researching how fake reality is and I think that deserves a medal or something.  I probably beat the odds.  Maybe that's why it's so hard for people to consider even elementary conspiracy theories.  It's maddening to deal with; it really is, and I don't think I get enough credit for trying to figure it out, but maybe that's what Jesus meant.  Forget about credit, I get ostracized.  My best friends are subconsciously terrified of me!  Of what I might say.  I'm like the luckiest guy in the world that I have 1 friend who actually can see it.  It's all so obvious I don't need confirmation from someone but it is definitely nice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alex Jones, the face of the conspiracy theory, looked like death on the last Joe Rogan experience.  He says he can't do this anymore.  He even backed off of Sandy Hook because of the backlash he must have taken and look, there's no way you can study sandy hook conspiracy without becoming traumatized.  That's little kids dying.  It's as bad as it gets.  I don't know if Alex Jones is propped up by the system as controlled opposition or if Alex is even aware of it.  He helped open my mind up and move past him and my gut tells me that he believes in what he's saying and even believes sandy hook was a conspiracy but he felt he needed to back off of that scintillating issue to survive and make no mistake, it is killing him.  He's banned from certain platforms but overall I think the system finds him tolerable because he isn't handling it in the best way or the best role model for truthers.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once you self-educate yourself and graduate from truther school you are supposed to move on and live your own life, avoiding the bullshit anderson pooper scooper spews out of his mouth. 
                </p>
                <p>On the bright side, if this life is a test and you aren't gobbling up anderson pooper scoopers dogshit then you've passed.  You have kept the faith.  There's still a lot of work to do but overall it's obvious they're trying to trick the population and whatever they want from that they aren't getting it from us, unless you're still stuck on sandy hook or 911 or pick your favorite conspiracy.  Understand it's bullshit, and move on.  It's impossible to use the evidence you find on other people anyway, so prove it to yourself and move on.</p>
                <p>
                    In regards to Sandy Hook, I don't know what happened.  I haven't studied it in years, but I will never forget Robbie Parker, alleged father of the slain Emily Parker, who was laughing his ass off leading up to his somber press conference when he didn't realize he was on camera.  Again, if that isn't weird to you, then it's probably also not weird to you that we're trying to go to Mars when we haven't even been to the moon in 50 years.  That's similar to entering the olympics for swimming at age 50 when you haven't even swam since high school, and thinking you're going to get the gold medal.  That's actually a bad metaphor.  Let me think of a more apt one, because we never even went to moon at all. It's like someone claiming the pyramids were built by slaves thousands of years ago, but we still can't build them today, despite all the advancements in technology.  Well maybe they weren't built in the way you were told.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    And if you think we haven't been to the moon since 1969 because we don't want to go well then how do you explain the fact that space is all the rage right now!  Look at what SpaceEX is supposedly doing besides embedding SEX in their name and shooting a black dick into space.  I liked Elon Musk, and the idea of him, but all of the sudden he's the richest man in the world?  The whole appeal of Elon was that he risked all his own money to bring us these badass companies that might fail so we should all buy his products and support him and now he's richer than Jeff Bezos?  The narrative just fell apart as far as I'm concerned and I just flat out don't believe him anymore. He's definitely the coolest dude on the planet but how real he is at this point I just don't know.  The SEX thing really is quite telling.  How about you go livestream on the moon first before selling us all on Mars, Elon?  I don't know.  Sometimes I think guys like him and even Einstein and Stephen Hawking are used to push lies.  Neil Degrasse Tyson's favorite thing to do is push lies.  I don't know if he even knows that they're lies.  Why did the big bang occur Neil?  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Any public genius or intellectual who doesn't acknowledge the elephant in the room of the elementary level of conspiracies going on cannot be trusted.  Even Jordan Peterson who's taught me so much, and Elon who's inspired me, even they are suspect.  How could anyone be that smart and miss something so basic?  Well, one explanation is that I'm wrong, not them.  However, it's not debatable.  There's simply no way Lee Harvey Oswalds bullet could have done what it did, or the twin towers could have fallen the way that they did, without an alternate explanation.  So these public intellectual heroes are just a joke to me at this point.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    The entire world is so far past insane that you couldn't pull them out of it in a million years, possibly eternity.  I haven't figured out why that is but I heard an interesting theory that it's because of something they've already decided in the future that's affecting their past which is right now.   I had never thought about that before.   I know the present can affect the past but I forgot about the future affecting the present under the same principle of retrocausality.   And again, I'd much rather talk about retrocausality and Parallel Universes and the teaching of Jesus than Lee Harvey Oswald but these people wouldn't pass the first day of kindergarden of a real school designed to actually help you learn. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our school system is a complete joke.  That alone is proof of everything I'm saying.  You know school's a bunch of bullshit; you went through it. You could make it through Ivy League with a post graduate degree and still be a total moron by objective standards.  A total moron who thinks it's red vs. blue and not the royal color of purple.  You know how they call it "left wing" and "right wing"?  Has it ever occured to you that the left wing and right wing can be two wings of the same beast?  It doesn't care what wing you worship if it stays perched on the throne.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This isn't for you, this is for me so I don't go crazy again.  If you want to know what I think, you can come here for a unique perspective.  I'm not posting it on facebook so it shows up on your news feed in between cat videos and selfies.  I'm just telling it like it is for anyone who has two brain cells left to rub together. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I don't think I'm some supergenius who can see things others cannot.  There's some truth to that as I am in the top like 1% of chess players in the world but thinking hasn't been my strongsuit.  I've lived a well-rounded life with Athletics, and girls, and parties, and I think my talent and purpose lies in my ability to relate to anyone in person and to kind of meet you on your level.  I can speak confidently in a crowd and have leadership and teaching ability.  But I'm not a supergenius.  I'm just frustrated that no one can see the most basic of things about this reality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There's something spiritual going on where maybe I'm an old soul or a different type of incarnation than the vast majority of people who can't see with their own eyes anymore unless the news tells them what they're seeing. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I don't hate you.  Do I think I'm better than you?  Maybe, but I recognize that as a flaw.  I think there's a ton wrong with me and the world is somehow a reflection of myself because I'm part of it and it is sick so I must be sick as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In a scenario like this where 1984 is coming to life and the ministry of truth is starting to censor more and more "fake information" there's little to look forward to other than the coming of Jesus.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm actually kind of mad at myself for not predicting this virus crisis, so I'm going to try to predict the next thing.  The virus is like their evil little plan to put everyone in masks and keep us separated to basically divide and conquer our souls.  So what's next?  They rode the terrorism train about as long as they could before they had to come up with the next phase of a virus crisis.  So what's next?
                </p>
                <p>One idea I have is that they'll claim to discover a "murder gene" and they'll use it to be able to genetically modify all babies at birth, to install whatever programs they want into them to truly make people subhuman.</p>

                <p>That's one direction they could go when we get tired of the virus business, or they at least accomplish what they want to with the virus and then choose to move on.</p>

                <p>
                    Remember they said 2 weeks and it's been idk 2 years maybe?  Whatever.  Do you know I wouldn't even be surpised if I was kidnapped by reptilians in the night who threatened to kill me if I stopped making this website.  I would laugh and roll my eyes at them.  That's how fucking batshit this all is.  Nothing, and I mean absolutely nothing, would surpise me.  The only thing that would surpise me is if everything got fixed and only the truth prevailed barring Jesus coming back.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Okay so if I had to try to predict another manufactured crisis I'm trying to think of what they want to do to us next.  Let's see, we've hacked all their emails and phone calls, we've put them under house arrest and put them in masks... what else can we do?  Maybe modify their genes at birth like I said.  Maybe... maybe we could have them use autopilot!?  That's it.  You know like the movie Click?  When he fast-forwards and misses all the little things in life, and he's just a zombie?  I bet you that will happen in reality someday where technology will give people the option of automating their own bodies for certain periods of time and then get to use their brains and bodies when they get home from work for a few hours.  Idk.  Would that surpise me if people lined up for that?  No, it would not.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    So we could genetically modify them at birth, we could get them to completely surrender their consciousness to us to fast forward their conscious experience... what else could we make them do?  And trust me I'm not giving the Devil any Ideas; he's way smarter than 1000 me's put together.  I'm just trying to think it through.   Let's see...  we could get rid of the men, just make a population of women to serve us and have the sperm banks somehow stay operational.  Not sure how they'd pull that one off but they certainly want not only men gone but women too.  So there would have to be a push towards a genderless society.  Lets see, we've already kind of broken down the family, and attacked masculinity as toxic and feminity as inferior... Let's make them learn from the government instead of their parents!  "Hey Satan"  A gargoyle yelled.  "yes?" Satan asked.  "We already did that one."  "Oh yes, I forgot, common core is my favorite."


                </p>

                <p>
                    What does the Devil have for us next?  
                </p>
                <p>
                    How about fake aliens!  That seems like it's already underway.  That's probably it.  So they'll probably have elon musk's black space dick make contact with a fake alien civilization that wants to come live with us.  Sure! Come on down.  Then we'll have demons walking around interbreeding with us, I don't know.  Would that surpise me if we made contact with aliens in the next 10 years and somehow it was a conspiracy to gain more power over us humans and dehumanize us further?  No, it would not surprise me.  And no, save your comments about my own sanity and take yourself to the shrink for both of us and ask for the placebo instead of your pills because they're just as effective, and they're cheap and taste better. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can take a sugar pill and experience the same effects as a drug.  Okay?  That tells you all you need to know about reality.  Some people shrug it off as insignificant and I haven't learned how to not see those people as total morons.  The Placebo effect changes everything and is verifiable proof that your mind has way more power then your world view allows for.  Government is... wait for it... dare I say.... governing your mentality?  Is that too much of a stretch there for ya? Ya, I thought so.  Again, a post for no one.

                <h1>Call of Duty: Cold War 9.5/10</h1>
                <p>This game is getting better and better.  They keep releasing new weapons, maps, and zombies maps all for free.  They also balanced some of the weapons like the MP5 and buffed some of the bad guns so I think it's a lot of fun now.  The zombies mode is super fun and I love the multiplayer team deathmatch mode.  Even the scorestreak system is cool because it discourages camping because if you die your scorestreak does not reset.  They just released more weapons, maps, and a theater mode.</p>

                    <p>
                        I finally got my shotty and sniper class diamond.  To get a weapon diamond you have to get every weapon in the class gold.  To get a weapon gold you have to complete all weapon camo challenges.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To complete all weapon challenges you have to get 20 instances of 5 kills in a row without dying using only that weapon.  This is much harder than it sounds because if someone comes up behind you and you switch weapons to kill them it resets your kill count on your primary weapon.  So I would have to snipe, and then retreat and snipe their assault instead of just whipping out my shotgun.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There were only 3 snipers and 2 shotguns at the launch of the game.  Now there are 4 snipers and 3 shotguns.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Streetsweeper</h2>
                    <p>
                        The best shotgun is the streetsweeper.  It's the newest shotgun and you can see it in my picture.  I have more kills with it than any other weapon because it is an 18 round fully automatic one shot kill.  It dominates, however they just balanced it with a season 3 patch and now it struggles to get one shot kills and also suffers in midrange aiming down sights where it used to be functional.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This class was the best, but now I think I have to run my AK74U for close range again after the nerf of the Shotty.
                    </p>
                    <h2>LW3 Tundra</h2>
                    <p>
                        The best sniper is the Tundra you can see above.  It's the strongest sniper before the latest one released super recently but it's also deadly accurate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The key to winning in Cold War is to have 2 weapons. 1 for long range and 1 for short range, and then to choose your battles carefully.  If every engagement I get into is long range with a sniper or close range with a shotgun I'm going to have a kill death above 1.6 which I do for that reason.  Really it's probably closer to 2 when I'm actually using a sniper shotgun, because sometimes I'm messing around with a revolver and tomahawk.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can see my perks above and I will explain why they dominate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Perk Greed is the best way to go.  You get 6 perks and 2 from each perk class.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Perk 1</h2>
                    <h3>Flak Jacket</h3>
                    <p>
                        Flak Jacket is so dominant they had to nerf it but it's still super clutch to survive otherwise deadly explosions.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Engineer</h3>
                    <p>
                        I use engineer for 1 reason.  Stealth.  In Perk 3, you can only chose 2 of them, unless you're rocking Law Breaker and can grab 3 of any perks you want and 2 primary weapons.  Since I use Ghost Ninja in perk 3, that means I cannot also use Spycraft.  Spycraft prevents you from showing up on field mics, which are like stationary personal radars.  With Engineer, I can see the field mics through walls, so I can at least know not to walk into anyone who is ready to ambush me.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Perk 2</h2>
                    <h3>
                        Gearhead
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Gearhead is the best perk two because it lets you charge up your equipment faster and store 2 of them.  Field Mics are incredibly powerful.  I can put one on the stairs of where I'm sniping from, and then it will alert me when someone is coming up the stairs and I'll pull out my shotgun and blow them away.  It's necessary.
                    </p>
                    <h3>
                        Quartermaster
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Quartermaster allows your grenade to regenerate.  I use frag grenades because they got a buff and flak jacket got a nerve and I can cook them and bounce them off walls at the start of matches and when I'm sniper but people are hiding.  Having them regenerate means I can feel free to chuck them and get some free kills without regretting a wild throw later.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Perk 3</h2>
                    <p>
                        Perk 3 are the most important by far.  When I have Law Breaker and can choose any 3 perks I want from any perk tree, I choose all 3 perks from Perk 3.
                    </p>
                    <h3>
                        Ghost
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Ghost in Cold War prevents you from showing up on enemy radar. It doesn't work if you're not moving.  This is a cool concept and causes me to move around and flank people whenever they use a UAV.  It's a necessary perk and you have to combine it with ninja, otherwise everyone will be ready for you.
                    </p>
                    <h3>
                        Ninja
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Ninja used to be overpowered and prevent detection by field mics but they moved that to spycraft.  It's still the best perk in the game because you can sprint up to someone and they won't hear your footsteps.  It's all about getting the drop on people.  If you can hear someone coming up behind you, they're as good as dead.  Don't be that guy.  Use ninja 100% of the time.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Tactical Equipment and Lethal</h2>
                    <h3>Frag Grenade</h3>
                    <h3>Field Mic</h3>
                    <p>
                        I already kind of mentioned these but they are the best.  Semtex can be nice too. C4 isn't as good in this game.  RPGs are worthless too.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Stim Shot</h3>
                    <p>
                        They had to neft the stim shot and slow the healing speed but it's still the best and I recommend having the same tactical for every class because it becomes instinctual to press L1 after getting shot, so you don't want to be flashing or stunning yourself.  Stim shot recovers health quickly and combined with flak jacket you can usually survive two grenades by healing in between the two explosions.
                    </p>
                    <h2>
                        Killstreaks
                    </h2>
                    <h3>War Machine</h3>
                    <p>This Grenade Launcher is ridiculously strong and makes one a master of death.</p>
                    <h3>Blackbird</h3>
                    <p>
                        If you're on a killstreak with your war machine and you get a blackbird (advanced UAV) you are basically immortal.  You can blow people up around corners.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Gunship</h3>
                    <p>
                        The best killstreak in the game.  If you combine your blackbird and war machine effectively you can finish the game from the AC-130 in style.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That combination of killstreaks is good enough that I was 29-0 once before the game even really got started.
