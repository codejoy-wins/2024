        Just made a <a href="https://primewords-1ad95f96dc03.herokuapp.com/">little anagram finder app</a> I call it Prime Words.
    </p>
    <p>
        Been also working on <a href="https://reviewandme.netlify.app">a social review app</a> book review app with Next.JS / React and Mongo Database.
    </p>
    <p>
        I think a dev log might be a good idea for my current projects.  I basically have 3.

        Project #1 is this website, it's not perfect, but I still do most of my coding on this site even though I want to get better at using React features with Next.js.  I'm currently happy with the site as is!
    </p>
    <p>
        I just revamped the <a href="projects.html">/projects</a> page and I'm really happy with it.

        Project #2 is the continued development of my backend skillset.  I've been using React and Next.js, as well as Node.js and Express, and I'm thinking of getting back into Python / Django.

        Project #3 is my Unreal Engine projects.  I am currently working on the Shock Rifle demo, and I just added A.I. enemies today that follow you around.  I also have some other Unreal Projects in Third Person like one you can toggle Ghost Mode and go through walls and floors and ceilings, or one with attack animations and coin collection, magic carpets and teleportation.  I'm definitely getting better at Unreal and that's really cool.   But both Next.js and Unreal Engine are tough because they're industry standard and top of the line.  It's a lot to handle for a solo dev.  This is currently being worked on!

        I just started using Sora to make a trailer for my game.  My goal is to make a shippable demo.  I got promoted at work and I'm a Senior Test Technician and a line lead at the local supercomputer factory.  
    </p>
    <p>
        Enjoy that goofy trailer I made with iMovie template and Sora and some clips of my game developing.
