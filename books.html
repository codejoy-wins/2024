            <h3>Cloud Cuckoo Land</h3>
            <h4>Anthony Doer</h4>
            <img class="piclarge" src="static/img/cuckoo.jpg">
            <p>I read this book because I've written about my ideal in Cloudland</p>
            <p>I don't believe in coincidences so I felt I was supposed to read this book when I saw it at Barnes and Noble</p>
            <p>Coincidentally my Mom had already read it and said it was terrific but you have to get through it because it takes a while to intertwine the seperate storylines</p>
            <p>The Payoff is so big at the end that it's worth the long slog.</p>
            <p>The prose made me feel like I will never be a professional author.  He's that good.</p>
            <p>In the story Cloud Cuckoo Land is reference to a sort of utopia a fool believes in, and it's a funny story about the fool in pursuit of cloudland, but the main storyline is about how that text survives over time and how powerful stories can be to humanity.</p>

            <h3>The Name of the Wind</h3>
            <h4>Patrick Rothfuss</h4>
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0756404746/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0756404746&linkCode=as2&tag=117027-20&linkId=97155989b125aca99f70310c00d4f313"><img src="static/img/kvothe.jpg" alt="Kvothe" class="piclarge"></a>
            
            <p>This is the first book of a trilogy with the third book currently unreleased.</p>
            <p>
                I found this book to be very interesting at parts.  
            </p>
            <p>
                It's a story of a man telling his life story.  I like the parts of the book that take place during present time.
            </p>
            <p>
                When he's telling his story.  I liked the beginning and the end, but I was bored while he was at wizarding school.  The University was surprisingly boring.  
            </p>
            <p>
                However, I think it was in a way deliberately boring.  It was making the magic and the character more grounded.  
            </p>
            <p>Ultimately it picks up the pace at the end and I really liked how it ended.</p>
            <p>
                I think I will buy the second book and read it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some of the writing is spectacular but I definitely got annoyed by the boring middle of the book so I will give it a 4/5.
            </p>
