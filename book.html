                    &emsp;"Mr. Anderson!"  Agent smith repeatedly says to Neo in the Matrix.  Why?  Smith was antagonizing Neo, trying to get him to identify with his Matrix name, because he was the God of the Matrix simulation, and as long as Neo plays by the rules of the Matrix, he'll lose.  Agent smith has Neo in a chokehold on the traintracks as a train approaches.  How does Neo win?  He loosens the chokehold just enough to be able to say, "My name is Neo!" and then he rises up and slams Smith into the ceiling before blackflipping out of the way just as the train comes and hits Agent Smith.  Neo is an anagram for "One" and Neo was the one.  Elam is an anagram for "Male" and I am the alpha male.  I'm here to teach you how to loosen the devil's chokehold just enough for you to be able to take a breath and tell him who you really are.  You are God's children, and he can't prevent you from getting closer to your heavenly father and finding out your purpose in life, like I've found mine.  All he can do is try.
                </p>
                And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.

                 My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand.

                I and my Father are one.

                    &emsp;I am a White Blood Cell.  I detect an illness in the body we're a part of and I intend to engulf that illness with love and to sacrifice myself for the good of the body.  This book will not make you more like me.  It will make you more like you, by reconnecting you to your unobservable truth, and freeing you from observable lies.  Statistically, if you're reading this, you are probably a Red Blood Cell.  RBCs are equally as valuable to the body as WBCs, as they carry oxygen to and from the lungs to keep the body alive.  White Blood Cells need to move quickly and recent 3D imaging has shown they do this by shapeshifting until they reach the site of the infection.   The white blood cell does not waste time trying to get the red blood cells to see the disease, nor does it try to convince them to get out of the way.  Instead, the WBC takes whatever shape it needs to on the way to get the job done.  I will do whatever I have to do, and be whoever I have to be to get my job done.  It's not about letting my end justify the means, because there is no end in eternity, and this is an infinite game like Simon Sinek says.  It's about doing the right thing, moment to moment, taking the right shape, to stay on my path.

                    &emsp;What is the illness I seek to heal?  More important than that is the cure.  The cure is openmindedness.  If I say, "Jesus", some of you will immediately close this book. But Jesus wasn't a Christian.  Jesus was a man.  Religions based on that man's life that have turned you off are not his fault.  I need to be able to quote scripture in this book to provoke thought, but without the heavy attachment of the churches I disavow.  Jesus didn't have a Jesus.  He had a personal connection with his Creator, the Creator, and did His will, and was able to accomplish great works.  We can use the example of Jesus to better connect with our own Creator, and that is our only defense against the Devil and the greatest trick he ever pulled.  When we connect to the Creator, we find out why we were created.  We are emboldened to embrace our individuality and my intent with this book is to empower you to become what you are and who God made you to be.

                    Chapter 11
                </h2><p>
                    
                    &emsp;Nietzsche's critique of Christianity in the book "Beyond Good and Evil" is the most brilliant one of all time.  I will attempt to explain it, and then turn it against itself.  
                </p><p class="ital">

                    Explaining It
                </p><p>
                    &emsp;At the dawn of morality, there was a caveman with a basic sense of good and bad.  Water was good.  He was good.  Drought was bad.  Physical strength was good and weakness was bad.  When another caveman came along, both would have the same basic morality, but the stronger of the two might bop the other one on the head with a club and take his stuff.  The strong caveman would also get the girl.  When the cavemen interacted, the stronger man was the weaker man's master.  The weaker man was seen as bad by the strong man. Bad at fighting, bad at protecting himself, bad at getting women.  The strong cavemen had the first type of morality and that is what Nietzsche calls the "Master Morality".
                </p><p>
                    &emsp;Nietzsche talks about the will to power we all have.  The master caveman is able to excercise his will to power successfully; he takes what he wants.  The weak caveman is not able to fulfill his will to power because the strong man overpowers him.  The weak cavemen is the strong caveman's slave, and his will to power is suppressed.  But Neitzche argues the will to power in people is so strong that it finds a way to eventually come out.  Nietzsche says the slave had to invent a new type of morality to take his power back from his master.  Normally the slave would see himself as bad, and the master as good, but in order to see himself as good, the slave calls the master "evil" and himself "good".  Good became Evil, and Bad became Good, just so the slave could live with himself.  "My master is evil. If I had his power, I would never do that" is what the slave says to make himself feel morally superior, because he can't feel physically superior.
                </p><p>
                    &emsp;Another way to think about Good and Bad vs. Good and Evil is with basketball.  You are either good or bad at basketball.  That's a skill.  But who would you call "Evil" in basketball if you had to?  Is it the good players or bad players? It's Lebron James on the Heat dunking on people.  It's Michael Jordan pushing off.  It's Kobe Bryant as the Black Mamba.  As you can see, Good and Evil are two sides of the same coin, and the other side of the coin is Good and Bad.
                </p><p>
                    &emsp;Christianity, he argues, has the ultimate slave morality, because it gives the powerless power.  It calls the poor blessed and says the rich won't go to Heaven.  It gives victims of crimes an avenue to moral superiority.  It condemns evil.  It turns the other cheek instead of fighting back.  It says the meek will inherit the Earth.  It says you have treasure in Heaven and get to live forever, while your captors or masters are going to hell.  It comforts the man who can't get laid by saying lust is wrong.
                </p><p>
                    &emsp;Is your morality really your own morality?  Or is it your will to power satisfying itself in a roundabout way?  To put it simply, Good became Evil and Bad became Good.  The reason girls like "Bad Boys" is because deep down they know that what we call "Bad" today is actually Good in disguise. "Bad Boys" are good at getting girls off.
                </p><p class="ital">
                    
                    Turning it against itself
                </p><p>
                    
                    &emsp;Lucifer, God's favorite angel, uses this master morality to try to say that "Goodness" is just weakness in disguise.  The devil argues that if man were given power, he would abuse it.  "Do what thou wilt" is a Satanic mantra, and embraces the master morality argument of discounting Christian ideas of good and evil and instead just going after what you want and being either good or bad at that.  Lucifer is known as the light-bringer.  He calls himself light and views himself as exposing the darkness that is the slave morality of Christianity.  The Irony is that Lucifer lost his war in Heaven.  Lucifer is a loser who had his will to power suppressed in heaven by Archangel Michael who defeated him in battle even though Lucifer turned himself into a dragon.  Rather than accepting that he is bad and God is Good, after losing the war with God without God even lifting a finger, Lucifer declares himself Good.  He tries to get humans to see him as the bringer of truth, the light bearer, when really he is the Father of lies.  Lucifer's master morality is actually the slave morality of heaven.  The light of the world is Jesus.  The truth is that God is Good, and Jesus is the light he shined on the world on how to be good.  The Illuminati, is actually dark, but calls itself illuminated for the same reason the slave calls himself good when he is actually bad.

                    Chapter 100
                </h2><p>
                    
                    &emsp;Jesus Christ is the Son of God.  He is the light of the world.  If we are judged it is because we preferred darkness because our deeds were evil.  We have to repent and embrace the light and only then will we be available to hear anything that is true.  If we have ears to hear, and eyes to see,  The truth will set us free.  And once we all link up to truth and love and Jesus and our Creator, we will be more powerful than even the Dragon.  I am Elam the Dragonslayer, and you are destined for greatness, but you have the free will to falter.  But no matter how far you have fallen, or sinned, which is an archery term for "missing the mark", if you are alive, you still have a chance to join God's team.  And let me tell you, when you're on God's team, you're going to win -- forever.

                    &emsp;Some of you may have wondered why my chapters seem to jump all over the place and skip.  Others of you may have already figured it out.  It's binary code for 1,2,3,4,5. Chapter 101 is 5 because the 1's represent on switches and the 0's are off switches for the powers of two.  The rightmost 1 is for 2^0 being on.  The leftmost 1 is for 2^2 being on.  2^0 = 1 and 2^2 is 4 so 4+1=5.   2^1 is switched off with a zero, so we wouldn't add 2^1= 2.  If we did have it on it would be Chapter 111 and mean chapter 7.  Even binary numbers always end in 0 because it's all powers of two being added to each other and the final digit is whether or not to add one for the odd numbers.  
                </p><p>
                    
                    &emsp;I hope this lesson shows you that some things that seem foolish are actually complexly accurate if you have the proper education.  I went to a coding bootcamp and learned how to do web development.  I went to UCSC and learned how to do philosophy.  I taught myself how to design games.  I have been interviewed at Google, Amazon, and Meta but I've never gotten the job.  I am not sure computer programming is for me, but I'm glad I know enough to be able to code my own website, elamahpla.com, and write a philosophical blog.  The girl I'm seeing told me I should write a book and this is that book.  A cute 19 yearold girl thought you should have this.   Before I get into the crux of my book about what I think is going on in the world, and how you can arm yourself against it, I will share a little bit more about my background as a male.  In highschool I dated a girl who won the award for "Dream Date".   That means that when everyone thought about who they most wanted to go out with, they all thought of my girlfriend.  I was living the dream.  No doubt, I was, and loving every second of it.  But I believe dating her through highschool and college was key to me developing a belief in myself, that my own methods get results better than following anyone elses.  It also allowed me to stop playing the dating game and start figuring out what the truth of this place really is.  Some people are still chasing that perfect girl, with their head down hard at work,  I was lucky enough to be able to get her early, live my dream, and realize that there's more to life than having a good facebook page.  I don't mean to brag, what I mean to do is qualify myself as a potential alpha male with a valuable perspective.
                </p><p>
                    &emsp;It doesn't mean I'm more valuable than you.  Who am I to say who God values most?  All I can do is what I think God created me for.  He created me to glorify himself, and any glory I bring on myself in attempt to bring God glory is forgiven. One of the people with the highest IQ's ever, Richard Rosner, went to highschool multiple times and changed his identity each time, because he viewed highchool as a microcosm of life.  In that microcosm of my life, I was the alpha male.
                        Someone has to be the first pick of the draft, and score the most points.  I've done both of those things in my life. It's that person's responsibility to share their unique perspective with the tribe because life is a team sport.  I want us to win.  I'm not trying to trick you for my own benefit, I'm trying to get you to see the trick at my own expense.  You might think you are a better man than me, and more alpha.  You might have a hotter girl and a better life and do more good in the world.  You might be right, but most men live quiet lives of desperation, and I'm trying to save them, and I could use your help.
                </p><p>
                    
                    &emsp;In the movies about highschool they always had the buff jock who had the girl and then the nerdy nice guy who ends up with the girl.  I decided to do both.  I attacked from every angle, and tried to have no weakness.  I had big arms, a big brain, was nice, could play football, and guitar.  I even formulated a strategy of how to get any girl I wanted, which was to outcompete all other men.  I figured when I became a senior there would be no guys older than me and I was confident I could outcompete everyone in my grade level.  So I used my Junior year to plan for my senior year girlfriend.  I made myself the logical choice for junior girls with their boyfriends going off to college.  If love is a game, I had the best game.  The guy I looked up to the most when it came to women told me one day that I had surpassed even him and that was when I knew I had a unique perspective to share.  At that point it's between you and God.  When Gary Kasparov was so good at chess that no person could beat him, and they made a computer that was better than everyone else and it still couldn't beat Gary, chess was between Gary and God.  God is the creator, and has the ultimate knowledge of everything.  Every beautiful thing you experience, he put there for you to discover.  And the experts in their fields are alone with God.  God is always there.  Getting better at something only brings you closer to God, who is the best at everything.
                </p><p>
                    
                    &emsp;I know who I am.  I am Elam Ahpla, the alpha male.  Someone has to be, I just am.  It isn't Elon Musk, it's me.  It's not Elon; it's Elam.  He's a fraud, I'm real.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    When my highschool sweetheart left me I promptly failed out of college and developed shy bladder syndrome so bad I couldn't pee in public.  I was addicted to marijuana, porn, and call of duty.  After a few painful years, I triumphed over my anxiety and got back into and graduated from UC Santa Cruz.  I studied philosophy because I wanted to know the truth of life before I lived it, and now it's time for you to hear the truth.

                    &emsp;What's happening in the world is we are being pushed in a certain planned direction by the events that seem to happen randomly.  The official story is that we were attacked on 9/11 and had to respond the way we did.  We were blindsided by this coronavirus and had to shutdown the world and inject people with mRNA technology.  That's not the way the world actually works.
                </p><p>
                    
                    &emsp;The problems we think we face are not real.  They are orchestrated.  Then they induce a fear reaction from the public.  The solutions are presented to us as the only option and we agree to go along with them and give up some of our freedoms, tax dollars, or privacy.  This is a systematic attack on you specifically, and you need to wake up.  My job is to wake you up so we can win.  And if I can't wake you up, it's my job to say, "No." No to the mRNA injection.  I would rather die.  No to the mask mandates at work.  I would rather quit.  At my insurance job I left work and didn't come back until they got rid of the mask mandate for everyone.  The world needs men like me, even if they don't know it.  It should be a personal choice to wear the mask, and the cons outweigh the pros.  We are running out of time.  What we need, is a breakaway civilization, with new laws and new news and new everything.  Then we need to do a basic experiment and see which civilization does better, the new one I call Cloudland, or the old.  Because increasingly the power of this world is a global force of totalitarian takeover.  We must escape it and declare our independence if we want to keep our values intact and avoid the increasingly pushed moral relativism.

                    &emsp;The bad guys of this movie are the ones that created the virus with gain of function research.  They planned out the vaccine ahead of time and injected most of us.  Any sermon that doesn't warn you against this vaccine or doing what the government tells you to do or believe is worthless.  I am here to warn you.  I'm here to save you.  I'm going to be as loud as I possibly can until it kills me, and the disease at the same time.

                    &emsp;Remember to keep an open mind.  Jesus says the devil would deceiveth the whole world.  Regardless of what shape the earth is, hypothetically, if it was flat or hollow, that would illustrate the depth of the lies here and how skilled Satan is at tricking you.  The covid virus has never been isolated.  The inventor of the PCR test said not to use it to diagnose viral infections.  The inventor of the mRNA technology said not to get the vax.  The media is full of shit on every single channel.  Even the truth channels, are flooded with fake truth to poison the well.  The social networks are policed and our ability to think and discuss has been damaged.  Misinformation campaigns are excuses to police free thought and keep your mind in a tiny box.  Google is there to spoonfeed you politically correct answers.  I think Google's search engine is a wonderful tool, but these are precarious times for our minds and we are at war.  It's a spiritual war, a mind war, an invisible war, and a secret war.  We blew up ourselves on 9/11.  It's called a False Flag where we blame someone else so we can attack them with public support.  We lied.  Satan is responsible.  He can slip in and out of people like how any person not unplugged from the Matrix can become an agent.  You better start believing in ghost stories, Elizabeth; you're in one.
