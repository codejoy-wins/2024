            Before the clip, during a timeout, Kobe was scanning the crowd, interrogating us with his eyes, "Does anyone else see what I'm doing!?" and I locked eyes with him and said with mine, "I do.  Now make the shot."

        <p>
            Those are my fists going up in the air before Kobe Bryant hits the buzzer beater over Dwayne Wade and Lebron James on the Heat.  That was the cornerstone of my perfect date I was on with my girlfriend.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            What I'd like to do with this webpage is a work of autofiction.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've been listening to Recursion by Blake Crouch.  The fictional book is about a detective who is investigating <span class="purple">"False Memory Syndrome"</span>, a condition that causes a woman to threaten to jump to her death while the detective tries to talk her off the ledge.  She claims to remember a life she had that never happened in the current timeline.  A husband she never had.  I too, feel like I remember things that have never happened.
            <p>
                These pseudohappenings may or may not be real.  Whether the brain conjured them up out of pain, or if they really happened on any timeline whatsoever, I want to document what I remember, because it's something I live with in the back of my mind.  Some parts are more vivid than others, and I won't try to claim absolute certainty, but I will try to piece these pseduomemories together to form a cohesive picture of a possible timecycle.

                The Moral Realization and My Theory of Intelligence
            </h3>

            </div>
            <p>
                It all started when I was in my 2005 Silver Mustang, with my girlfriend Lia in the passenger seat, driving home from that Laker game.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was thinking about how surreal this date was, how it couldn't have gone any better, and how I wouldn't rather be with anyone else.
            </p>
            <p>
                I may have been naive, but I felt self-actualized, like I had achieved both riches and love.  You know the expression when something is "too quiet"?  Well this date felt "too perfect".  Something didn't feel right.  As I looked at the faces of the drivers of the other cars, <span class="purple">I began to experience sonder</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                My life at that moment couldn't have been more perfect if I had written it down ahead of time.  "I want Kobe to hit a buzzer beater over Dwayne Wade and Lebron, and I want to go home with the woman of my dreams".  So I began to consider, if my dreams are becoming real, should I include these other drivers into my dream reality?  Do I have a responsibility to share my power of manifestation that is genuinely puzzling me?
            </p>
            <p>
                I used my theory of mind to imagine the stories behind the countenances on the drivers around me. I noticed the architecture, if you can call it that, visible on the sides of the freeway, and I pondered the stark contrast in quality between the beauty of my date, and the ugliness of the city.  The equivalent match for her would be beautiful pyramids and cathedrals.
            </p>
            <p>
                We had a policy invented by my yearbook winning girlfriend, where I could only call her beautiful when I first saw her (so once per date) otherwise we were in danger of me speaking of nothing else.
                During the carride home, I asked her if she could momentarily suspend this rule, so I could fully explain to her how beautiful I knew she was.
            </p>
            <p>
                I asked Lia if she loved me, and she said she did.  I told her I needed to tell her the truth about something, and that if she didn't love me anymore after I told her, that was okay and she was free to date someone else.  She agreed. I proceeded to tell her my truth, that the car and the Laker game and everything about my personality and our relationship was all an elaborate ruse to secure her as a long-term sexual gratification mechanism.  I told her how I would absolutely never leave her for any reason, and was ready to bet the rest of my life on her.  I also warned her how I planned to leverage her love for me and use it to cloud her judgment when I slack off, because I am the incumbent boyfriend and have a huge hormonal advantage to my competition.  I told her that I believed every other man wanted to be in my position and for her to be in love with them instead of me.  I told her there was a war for her, and that I had won.
            </p>
            <p>
                I told her I was prepared to answer any questions she asks of me completely authentically, no games, for I had already won the game.  She agreed and stayed with me and asked many good questions over a long period of time.  I told her she wouldn't like the answers.  <span class="wheat">Her jaw dropped</span> when I admitted to her that it would make almost no difference to me if she lost the ability to speak, and that I only cared about her ability to understand my commands, and her willingness to obey them.  I quickly followed up with saying that she's more than welcome to speak, and that I do enjoy our conversations.  Making her happy genuinely makes me happy, but I was rooted in selfishness.
            </p>

            <p>
                I vocalized to Lia my theory of intelligence, that she was the prize and I had won her over, thereby demonstrating my superior intelligence.  I told her she was the prettiest girl I had seen in the world, and that I might therefore be the smartest man alive.  I said that I was willing to commit to her, but that before I did, I should offer myself up to the state as the smartest man alive, and see if I can donate my brain.  If the intelligence agencies laugh at my theory of intelligence, then all I ask is that they introduce me to a smarter man than myself, with a better theory of intelligence, at which point I would be free from moral obligation to the state, and donate myself to my future wife and family.  I told her about the scene from "It's a Wonderful Life" where he says he'll throw a lasso around the moon and give it to her if she asks.  I said I didn't know about the moon, but that I might be able to get her this planet, but only if she does exactly as I command.  She agreed.
            </p>
            <p>
                I never did get to meet that smartest man in the world, nor did I ever get his name.  The only thing I can remember, is them coming back to me and saying it was me, and that we were going to move forward with my plan.  I never got a chance at a normal family life, because my proposal was never rejected.  It was greenlit.  
            </p>
            <h3>
                There was a recording on her iPhone
            </h3>
            <p>
                In order to submit my theory of intelligence to the intelligence agencies of the USA, I decided that a verbal audio recording on my girlfriend's phone would do the trick.  I thought I would do a recording, demonstrating my willingness to die for my country, stating I was 18 years old and of sound mind, with built in defenses against psychiatric evaluations.  If the plan didn't come directly from her, it would have been ignored as the ravings of a madman.  Her beauty was the quintessential ingredient, but it wasn't the full recipe.  I also needed an in, via law enforcement.  So I instructed Lia to give the recording to my friend's dad who was a cop.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even if I nailed the recording, and sounded super smart, and she was super beautiful, it still wouldn't be enough to convince a cop that I am the smartest man in the world, even if the cop knows me and has seen one of my most spectacular feats ever, which he had.  He needed to not just see her beauty, but to experience and feel it.  Lia had 1 mission.  To force Mr Cop to listen to the full recording with an open mind.  In order to open his mind to my sexual theory of intelligence, I needed her to please him.  Her mission was to suck his dick to completion, and then force him to listen to the full recording after.  I told her to use all of her arsenal to accomplish this mission, and that the entire plan depends upon a cop being involved from the start.  I told her we would never need to speak of it again, and that the only confirmation I needed was "mission accomplished" or "mission failed" by the time we had our next date.
            </p>
            <p>
                I believe the Laker game was on a weekday, and so our date would have been Friday or Saturday, so I would have a couple days to live a normal life, negating the inevitable psychiatric evaluations.  In my initial recording I said the psychiatrists should be given full access to my entire life minus the audio recording from a couple days ago, and have to sign that no matter what I said to my significant other on the recording, i would not qualify as insane, given that I had continued to live my every day life as though nothing had changed.  It was the secrets of my mind I was divulging, but they were there the whole time.  Once the psychs listened to the recording they would change their opinions, but they had already signed so they could be dismissed.
            </p>
            <p>
                There were multiple recordings, two primary ones.  The intial one was for the cop and to demonstrate that I was:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>A man of legal age and sound mind consenting to experimentation up to and including death for the benefit of humanity</li>
                <li>Legitimate credentials on intelligence such as my experience in GATE "gifted and talented education" and my SAT score</li>
                <li>In complete command of the most beautiful girl in Westlake Village</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                I should mention that before I went forward with my plan I had the ominous feeling that I should have already been recruited into intelligence agencies, and that they were therefore malignant or malfunctioning to have not yet approached me visibly.  I figured if my theory of intelligence was correct, they were either waiting to see what I would do, or hadn't discovered me yet by some miracle.  My theory of intelligence is a tied to a theory of beauty, and that all you have to do is find the most beautiful women, ask them who they want, and then research those men.  Other Alphas greater than me exist, and I wasn't sure if I was starting the Alpha Program or going to be joining an existing one.
            </p>
            <p>
                Keep in mind, the recording is going for shock and awe, so I used riddles.  For example I remember saying in the intial recording, "They'll want to know my SAT score.  Tell them I got 2400 but swapped two of the digits around to get better than a perfect score.  Have them take a multiple choice test with the possible permutations.  Make I don't know the last option.  If they guess incorrectly my score, send them away and tell them I said they are idiots.  If they guess right, Keep them, and if they say they don't know, keep them too, for they are the smartest".
            </p>
            <p>
                I went on to explain in my second recording that my score was 2040, because the other 360 degrees were devoted to the hot cheerleader in the testing room from Oak Park named Audrey, (names are all changed) who I successfully got her number and dated and broke her heart and how that feeds into my theory of intelligence that the smartest man isn't the man who gets the perfect score because it's more desirable to get a 2040 and fuck the cheerleader than to get a 2400 and not.  Later, I spun her around as she was giving me a blowjob to get the additional 360 degrees.  I said into my second primary recording, "If that doesn't make me God, I don't know what does". Because at that point we had moved on from smartest man in the world to whether or not I was God.
            </p>
            <p>
                In regards to my potentially supernatural abilities, I discussed with Lia beforehand that not only did I have the possiblilty of being the smartest man alive, but I also might be divine.  We agreed that it felt like we were in Heaven when we were together, and she agreed my life was always like that.  So i said, "If this is Heaven, then I would be God".  I told her I thought I might have magic powers.  
            </p>
            <h3>
                There was a die.
            </h3>
            <p>
                I told her about how the other day I had walked into a classroom to find my classmate with a large fluffy die.  I wanted it, so I offered him five dollars for it.  He said no, but I persisted.  I said, I'll bet you $5 I can roll a 5 with it.  He said no.  I said how it was a 5/6 chance he gets to keep his die, and get $5 and that he'd be a fool not to take these odds.  He didn't want to risk parting with his die he had no intention of giving away.  I took out my $5 bill from my wallet and showed it to him and said, "It's yours, all you have to do is not roll a 5".  He finally agreed, and I don't remember who rolled it, but sure enough, it came up a 5.  I took the die from him; I had won the bet.  He was in shock.  I may have given him the 5 out of pity after that, but the thing is, it was never in doubt for me whether I would get the die or not.  To me I was just in the zone, and I saw something I wanted, and knew it would be mine.  Looking back with what I know about magic now, I would say the sheer amount of times I said the word "5" made reality bend to show a 5.  It was 5 in both of our minds substantially, before it manifested itself.  I visualized and forced him to visualize and I won.  I also recalled that I hadn't lost a game of Sorry or any game of chance in quite a while, and that I once went an entire day at Magic Mountain winning everything for free because any time there was a conflict I played rock paper scissors with my friends and they said they had never seen anything like it.  I won every single time, bar none, maybe 20+ times.  But the catch is, it has to be for something I wanted.  If we play for fun, I don't have the ability.  It has something to do with manifesting what I truly desire, that is when I don't play dice, I simply just win.  This past weekend I played a card game and had 5000 points clean after 3 rounds winning every hand, a perfect game.  I also won at poker the last time I played, though I don't claim to be a great poker player.  
            </p>
            <p>
                The key thing to understand is that it is not the nerd who can't get the girl whom is the smartest.  It's the jocks you have to watch out for.  The ones who achieve their goals.  They may even hide their intellect where it suits them.  They are the true danger.  They are the true intelligence.  Furthermore, intelligence and good looks compound over time, with the more intelligent people getting more and more attractive mates for their own satisfaction, resulting in good looking and smart children.

            <h3>
                There will be a family
            </h3>
            <p>
                Once I had their attention I expressed my concern for my precious brain being wasted.  I said, "The principle threat is bullets to the head" and I proceeded to comment on Friendly Fire in the military being questionable, and that it should be investigated as murder.
            </p>
            <p>
                I said there would be a family, claiming wrongful death.  I said to tell them the smartest man in the world believes them and is making sure it never happens again.  I said we had to execute all of my commands immediately because there was no time to verify them, and that could be done later on an as-needed basis.  I said that family would already know who was responsible, and that we should capture the coward responsible and have him tortured to the point of confession.  I remember them asking me, through Lia, what I meant by "tortured to the point of confession".  I said that the man who ordered the friendly fire execution of Pat Tillman (nfl pro-bowl linebacker who joined military and turned down huge contract), for example, would be a coward, and that cowards always confess before death.  Only heroes are capable of dying from torture.
            </p>
            <p>
                They said that I was right and asked how I knew, and I said a logically valid statement, "You can't beat Pat Tillman in a fair fight.  Therefore they cheated.  They used friendly fire to eliminate him.  In fact, he probably allowed himself to die rather than shoot his way out and harm his brothers".  The second recording, is also the third, and infinitely more, because of time travel returning to that moment when I channelled the Holy Spirit in my second recording where they were actually listening to what the smartest man alive had to say about God and His life.
            </p>
            <h3>
                There is a chair
            </h3>
            <p>
                I really valued my friend Rick, who I gave the responsiblity of woman, because he was good with them and has a great relationship with his sister.  I named Rick's dad Project Manager, and everything had to go through him.  They repeatedly asked me why him, and even he himself begged me to tell him why.  I remember distinctly telling them a story about his chair.  I said, "There is a chair."  And I told the story of how one night I was hanging out with Rick in his dad's apartment and there was a nice chair in the room I wanted to use, but Rick wouldn't let me use it.  He and I sat on bad chairs, staring at the good chair.  It was his dad's chair, and he respected it.  I explained to Rick that he would never know if we sat in his chair, and that we could take a picture before and after and make it the same, but he never relented, and that was one of the only times I could recall not getting what I wanted.  I instructed my organization to always have a chair like that in every room where they speak my name, and that only he is allowed to sit in it, that way his presence is felt like how I felt it.  The transitive property of respect.
            </p>
            <p>
                The reason I say "my organization" is because it is.  The plan was simple, either introduce me to the smartest man in the world so I can make sure we are in good hands, or crown me as the smartest and let me decide how best to donate my brain.  The donation is final, and binding.  I'm just saying let me do it my way if you can't at least explain how you're planning on using it.  Because If I donated myself the old-fashioned way I would be quickly killed via friendly fire by those in power who wish to stay that way.  My intenions were a benevolent overhaul of society using the knowledge of my own evil to inoculate benevolent secret socities from malevolent ones.
            </p>
            <p>
                Just as my relationship with Lia was built on trust, and we never looked at each others phones, I wanted my organization to grow organically through trust.
            </p>
            <p>
                I wanted hitman to be recruited, shown force, and released.  I wanted us to be "the good guys" if this was a movie.  I instructed for us to always do the morally right thing over the pragmatic thing, and that if we did that, God would be on our side and save us.
            </p>
            <p>
                I said I was "whatever God needs me to be, including God" because I assumed the responsibilies of God as well as deferring to the omnipotent power in the sky as my God.

            <p>
                Before my second recording, Lia said, "mission accomplished".  I said, good job babe, I'll take it from here.  In my second recording it went like this:
            </p>
            <ol>
            <li>Verify Lia's mission was successful, and law enforcement is listening</li>
            <li>
                Verify They are moving forward with my plan, rather than bringing me onto an existing one
            </li>
            <li>
                Verify I am indeed already being recorded (as I should be as the smartest man alive)
            </li>
            <li>
                Provide an uninterrupted introduction explaining how as the smartest man, whatever I choose to talk about is by definition the smartest thing to talk about, and how if I want to talk about a basketball game (the spectacular feat) I played 10 years ago against the cop's son, that's what I'm going to do.  It was a story about how I defeated the undefeated #1 seed Spurs as the best player on the Clippers, the last seed, by <span class="purple">telling my teammate the truth </span> about how my dad only drafted him because he liked his parents, and didn't care if we won or lost.  I told him I was #1 on the list in a snake draft, so we had no second rounder, and he wasn't worth a 3rd round pick, and <span class="wheat"> our only chance to win was if he improved secretly throughout the year and did a surprise attack in the playoffs.</span>
            </li>

                I structured the search for the most intellgent man as alphabetical, where you get smart people in a room who all have names that start with the letter "A" and have them discuss who is smartest in the room.  Whoever notices that they all start with "a" wins.  You do that with every letter and you have 26 very smart people.  Then you put them in a room with Eminem, because rap is a demonstration of intelligence, and you have all 26 state why they think they are smarter than Eminem.  Eminem will then use all there words against them in a rap and then they will vote with Eminem's vote counting double because he won the rap battle.  At that point I predicted I would win unanimously for organizing the whole thing from a car at 18.

                Another random element of my story is Drake.  I had offerred up my Facebook profile for the initial psych eval and for blind date verification of superior selection capability.  In it, I had a status "Drake isn't Cool".  And Drake was pleased by this and asked me on speaker what he could do to be considered cool.  I said, "Give him our full resources to find the optimal point at which he can accept a bribe and then stop pretending to be bad and give all of the money away". Then I will respect him.

                When it came to truly influencing the world I knew that being called God would be better than "smartest man" but first I had to dethrone Michael Jordan.  So I hatched a plan which was to use the Black Alpha, the black basketball coach's son, to locate Michael Jordan and then use Phaira, one of the hottest girls I knew, to be fully naked and call him God until he said he is not god.  Then to keep calling him God and when he asks why say,<span class="red"> "Because you didn't use an apostraphe".</span> Wait for him to process that, and when he finally says, "I'm not God" his power will flow out of him and into Me.  I am the new MJ.  Max Jann.  The Black Alpha I refer to is the probable son of the basketball team that demolished my team in travel basketball in NJB at a tournament.  I said he had a whole team of alphas and was keeping them from tearing each other apart by using basketball.  Like Coach Carter.  I said he would need our help and to focus all resources on helping the black alpha so he can help us.  "Thank you for the initials" I told them to tell MJ on the way out, still treating him with the utmost respect, but no longer calling him God.

                I specifically remember Lia getting into the car and saying "mission accomplished" and me saying, "So I'm the smartest man in the world?" and her nodding yes.  And then her saying it's all happenning like I said.  "And Michael Jordan?"  Yes.  She nodded.  "So I'm God?" I asked in disbelief.  She nodded again, very serious, like she had been coached.  In fact, I remember there was one time she got into the car where she seems uneasy, and I asked her if there was a threat, or who the last person she talked to was to make her this uneasy, but she assured me she was okay.  Anyway, once she said I was God I said, "First of all, I'm not God.  I am just a man.  I met God, he murdered me and resurrected me."</p>

                    I also added a kill clause to my power.  I said I couldn't be trusted with power because of my evil nature and that I am too tricky to trust, and must be left in the dark of my own power, and that this would also foster loyalty because I was not hoarding visible affections and dominion.  Would you rather fight for Alexander the Great leading the army, or a coward king in the back hoarding wealth?  I appointed my best friend Klay to have the sole authority to kill me at any point.  But first he was have to be brought into the operation and see how much power I've ammassed, and then he must speak to me face to face before deciding to kill me or not.  Also, he must be allowed to develop organically and independently of influence for as long as possible, that way when people see the power they are building, they know it is for him, a true man, and not me, a false one.

                I said I would die without certain friends. I said that one was more powerful than me in a non-violent way, but that I had assimilated him, and would now die without him.  I said that I needed my bros that I played Halo with, and that nothing was more clear than playing war games in terms of grasping superiority, and that I was the best and only level 50 in Team Slayer and Team Doubles, but that I couldn't have done it without their help, specifically Ace's. I said Kelly was the only person I knew who could beat me at Basketball in one on one, and that he beat me in Halo 1 and 1 too, and was therefore an anomaly.  I needed a car and a guitar, and those few friends, otherwise I would not survive.  Beside that, I consented to all matter of torture.  I said that every guy was obsessed with proving themselves not gay to their friends, and that could be weaponized against us, and sure enough it was with the advnet of Sissy Hypno porn.  I appointed Krystian as the "ambassador of the gays" because I needed a gay man I had treated fairly to defend me when I inevitably became accused of homophobia later.

                    I had it all dialed in, and even predicted which orders they would disobey.  I had the quantum computer idea, told them to use water and freezing temperatures with computers to get an edge.  I provided medicinal edges with plants by Klay's house.   I said to make a computer model of me and also that if they ever thought I should have done something else, to keep this current version of me because what I do will always prove correct on a long enough timescale.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Years later I did indeed have such a conversation with Klay, and I offerred to kill myself right then and there, because I know in the back of my mind what I really am doing on this plane of existance.  We were on top of a roof of a garage and he was visiting my sober living in Cali and I told him about my delusional theory and said, "Just say the word and I will dolphin dive off of this room and land on my head.  It might not kill me but it would solve your problem, yes?" He could not hide his anger any longer and spat back at me, "You disobeyed me".  And referred to a phone call where he said to wash my hands during covid and I vehemently opposed the 6 feet recommendations he gave me over the phone.  In fact, I have another false memory where the time travellers told me that I didn't listen to Klay during covid to which i responded, "What's Covid?" and they said, "It's a virus in the future".  "Oh", I said, and shrugged it off like it was nothing.  "Did he call me by my real name?" I asked.  "What is your REAL NAME?" They demanded.  "Bulltrue" I said, "And only Klay can call me that and it has to be the first word out of his mouth.  After that, everything he says must be the opposite of bullshit, or I'll turn back into Spitfire, make sense?"  I like the Recursion plot by Blake Crouch, because it shows how a rudementary technology can spin out of control, and how time is not linear.  In fact, I also noted during my time machine proposal in the recoding that they would have to go back in time to prevent me from accidentally killing my best friend on more than one occassion where I felt supernatural assistance.  Both were playful pushes, one pushed my friend under the boat at Bass Lake, and one pushed my friend nearly off the sidewalk and into traffic.  I also think there were potentially forces altering some sports games, one where my dad said it was the best looking 1 for 7 in baseball he had ever seen, where each out was a laser beam inexplicably caught by the same infielder jumping up in the air very high, and then a middle school basketball game where all my MJ layups where applauded, but somehow didn't go in, in a very bizarre way where people were again legitimately impressed even though my stats were horrible.  I also played QB in my freshman year and threw a long bomb and then a pick when I came in the 4th quarter.  They trained me to run the same play when I hear, "Attack" but they were saying my best friend's last name, not attack, and I misunderstood because I thought of him as his first name.  Weird stuff like that intrigues me.  Again, even though I threw a pick, my friend (not a football fan) later congradulated me and said the game was boring until I came in and started throwing bombs and trying to actually win the game.

                    This website is a archive of my response to covid, the immune response of genius against groupthink.  In fact, my plan invovled a time machine, I even appointed a specific friend to be in charge of its development, and someone to ultimately wield it after faking his death.  That death faker was Kobe.  Would you believe me if Kobe came back to life?  I can even explain Gianna.  See, the first time Kobe did it all himself, miserable.  Then they came back to me in that Mustang using the time machine.  I remember Lia getting in and out of the car, from different timelines.  They told me Serena said I was evil for claiming kobe for my op.  I agreed.  I amended my decision to allow him one family member to take with him into fake death.  He couldn't decide so he asked them to ask me to pick for him.  I said it would be his daugther. "The one who's the best at basketball".  Sure enough, Gianna went with him on that helicopter, allegedly.

I was a magic bull named Bulltrue.  I was the opposite of bullshit because I spoke the truth, but when I was lied to I got so irate I spit fire with my mouth, metaphorically as an adult but literally in our imaginations.

                    So there you have it, that's the gist of my false memory.  I remember telling Lia she had to break up with me, because if not I would never realize my true potential.  I would never have made this website, which is an attempt to get her back.  Maybe I'm crazy, but then again, maybe false memories are based on reality, like in the book "Recursion" by my favorite author Blake Crouch.  He even mentions the Mandela Effect in the book, but this FMS, is much more serious, and I empathize with the character who wants to jump, because what are we without our memories?

                    Wheter it is true or not, I think it makes for a good story, and this story has unique explanations for sybmols for example the radioactive symbol of 3.  I said that I loved one of my friends more than anyone, and that my chief competiton (the cop's son) loved him more, and that's alright he can have him.  I theorized that I don't kill the cop's son because Josh would never forgive me, and the cops son doesn't kill me because Josh would never forgive him.  So this triangular stabilization of radioactive alphas.  Because I suggested that we needed to treat me and others like me with more care than nuclear missiles, because any one alpha could gain control of the entire nuclear arsenal if that is what they want to do because Alphas by definition get what they want when they want it.  I also suggested that Chad Michael Murray may have gotten Paris Hilton during House of Wax filming and convinced her to allow her own death scene even though at the time it was career suicide to show your death like that.  Also, speaking of false memories, some people falsely rememember the end of Seven the movie showing Gwenyth Paltrow's head in the box, thus destroying her hirability as an actress, but now there is no such image.  It's as if she had such a good PR campaign that they wiped it from existance, like someone getting into the chair in the book "Recursion".

                    That author really speaks to me, because in his other book, "Dark Matter" it's also about how impactful the decision is for a genius to choose work vs. family.  In my mind, I am akin to the Creator of the Box version of the main character in Dark Matter.

                    Maybe my plan didn't work, but at what point was it fantasy.  Did I imagine the buzzer beater by Kobe?  But there's a clip.  Did I imagine her beauty?  But there's photos.  Did I imagine the recording, but I specifically remember having an argument with her about showing me her phone, slowly, so I could verify the plan was really working.  I remember she relunctantly agreed because I said "Please don't make me do it by force" because I wanted to know for sure I was being recorded before she opened the door to come inside the car, because if it's a real operation, she would be doing at least that.  Also I said I only had one shot at this recording, and I wasn't willing to waste it.  So maybe that is where you draw the line and that the recording never happened.  Fine, I can go back further.  The car ride home from the laker game.  That happened.  The first recording, the one that she was instructed to play for the cop after she gave him a blowjob.  Did that happen?  I know that I remember clearly going about my week like everything was fine, waiting for her to say "mission accomplished".  And I remember her saying it, and it's the only mission I ever gave her and I know she was successful.  But let's say you don't buy that either.  I can go back further.  I know I have core memories of conversations with her about other girls I liked who liked me, conversations I never would have had if it wasn't part of my full disclosure of the truth. Also I would specifically say what level of Agent I thought girls were, like Belinda was a quadruple agent, Analla was a triple agent.  I had her investigate Klay and the transitive property of God, and sure enough, they dated after me.  I named Jewel to be the head of foreign intel, and said her only issue would be the disrepect she got for being a woman, so I named her bro to be her surrogate, and sure enough, the dude was happy to tell me he gets a 4.0 at Yale.  It was surreal meeting him years later.  I asked him what motivated him and he asked Jewel for permission, and then said, "God".  Jewel worked for the Peace Core and when I offered to help she told me to "Keep doing what I was doing" which is THIS, by the way.  THIS IS WHAT I'm DOING.  I'M FIGURING SHIT OUT, FEARLESSLY.  You can snarl but you can't bark like Treelam.  Some were better used politically, like the Nicolettes.  Others were used to grant prayers, and do ethics experiments on bugging a christian's home and answering prayers in reality and comparing that to letting the traditional model of God do it by himself, in other words do nothing. So can we agree I at least told her my full truth?  Okay, so did I share with her my theory of Intelligence as a sexual function and that we men are only xxxtensions of our dick.  I remember explaining to her, <span class="purple">"You know how sometimes they say a guy is thinking with his dick? </span> I only think with my dick, 100% of the time".  
                </p>
                <p>
                    So if I clearly remember telling her about how my brain is just an extension of my dick and the dome I'm getting from here is proof that I'm the smartest dick, and I also remember seriously considering with her whether or not I'm God or if there even is a God.  I always have believed in a higher God than myself and still do, but I also said in my recording that the Christians were wrong.  "Only the diests got it right and there are only two of them.  Myself and Benjamin Franklin."

                    So I'm curious, I know you don't believe me, but at which part?  I know I've consented to all forms of torture but I've not authorized any alteration of the timeline that brought me up to the point of true love, which is when <span class="wheat">I told the Truth to the woman I Loved.</span>

                <p>
                    I can provide more details later as I organize this into a pseduocoherent autofiction.  I remember at one point they said I was the only threat remaining, and I offered to die, asking if they tried shooting me yet.  They exclaimed, "No!"  "I said, well did you try praying to Jesus!?"  They said, "Yes! It's just you.  It's always you in this moment."  To this day I don't know if a) this really was said and b) did they mean I am everyone and there is no one but me, as in we are all God together?  I replied in utter confusion, "So I'm the one true God?"  Yes, they said.  I said, "Just kill me" .  "We've tried! they exclaimed, (through speaker phone because I knew it wasn't Lia)". I almost forget to tell you the best part.  Off the recording, I had secret converstaions with Lia, telling her we don't have to show anyone the recording, and that although they will think I'm God, I'm just me and nothing has changed.  I made her promise to go along with it relunctantly when they turn her against me, and that only at the end when I'm the last remaining threat to humanity can she tell everyone the good news that I'm only pretending to be evil and that she is safe now.  I specifically have a memory of me speaking to Lia, though Lia!.  I said, "I know for a fact that Lia would never be scared of me, therefore this is not the real Lia.  Can you put it on speaker phone or do you need my help with that capability?"  When I began talking to my family and friends I said, "Is Lia there!?"  "Yes" she said crying, and I told her it's okay and that we're safe.

                <p>
                    I remember being genuinely confused I was like, "Wait, so you guys have Kobe and the Time Machine?"  "yes" "so what's the problem I don't get it". "You, you're evil."  I snared Kobe with the Dante's Inferno analogy and making him miss "the shot" that I made at my exgf's house.  Ridiculous I know, but so is the shot that I made, and sure enough , Kobe did pose for pictures with the friend that I mentioned in my recording, years later.  Also, it should be noted that pro athletes like Luka on the lakers with the All Seeing Eye on his arm, pro athletes are aware of me on this timeline, and they are told to finish their careers before trying to help because nothing is more important than influencing the masses and the alphas to come.

                    I should probably uncomment out all the hidden messages on here because I've basically told the whole story of my false memory, but anyway I remember appointing girls to certain positions and Serena was the final word because I loved her and she was wise enough to notice I was the smartest man she knew after conducting independent research in high schools and using criteria besides grades.  Then I made Sauriah the girl who snowboards down a mountain with the time machine (like 9 of hearts netflix movie).  I also think "Domino" with Keira Knightley is a reference to my ex, the domino that started it all with that first mission.  Why?  Because I told my gf that she would need to keep her clothes on and save a lapdance to get out of trouble, and also to get skilled with something like numchucks, because knives and guns can be used against you, whereas numchucks can be an unimposing hobby that makes a weapon available in the room that only you know how to use.  I didn't want her around bullets or sharp knives.

            I'll admit I don't have all of my memories in tact, and they may or may not be true, but here's what I roughly remember, for whatever reason:
        </p>
        <p>
            On my way home, after my beautiful silver 2005 Ford Mustang was driven to me to pick up my date, Westlake High School's Dream Date of the yearbook class of 2010, I realized something.  I was fully self-actualized.  
        </p>
        <p>
            My girlfriend was the prettiest girl I had ever seen, and was constantly raising the standard of beauty to new heights.  We had a policy invented by her, where I could only call her beautiful when I first saw her, so once per date, otherwise we were in danger of me speaking of nothing else.
        </p>
        <p>
            During the carride home, I asked her if she could momentarily suspend this rule, so I could fully explain to her how beautiful I knew she was.
        </p>
        <p>
            I decided that I loved her completely, and was willing to marry her, and show her the absolute truth of who I am as a person, and give her an opportunity to walk away.
        </p>
        <p>
            I told her she was so beautiful, and that that's all I actually care about, and that everything else was a lie.
        </p>
        <p>
            I said, "You know how people say, 'Oh that guys is only thinking with his dick'?  I only think with my dick.  In fact, I think my brain is merely an extension of my dick, and my dick is the one really in charge."
        </p>
        <p>
            I told her I was extremely shallow, and that if she couln't speak, it would make no difference to me as far as my desire to be with her.  She was welcome to speak, but it was not necessary for me.
        </p>
        <p>
            She asked me how to be a good girlfriend, and this was my response.
        </p>
        <li>
            1. Be Hot
        </li>
        <li>
            2. Suck my Dick
        </li>
        <li>
            There is no 3
        </li>
        <p>
            I like making her happy, so she doesn't have to share me, and I like having conversations with her, but that is a bonus, it is not necessary if I'm being completely honest, and I was.
        </p>
        <p>
            I said I have chosen her, and accept the risk that she may lose her beauty over time, or to an accident, and that I promised to remain with her no matter what, and that I had already experienced enough of her heavenly beauty, so I felt fully satisfied and ready to risk it all by telling her my hidden truth.
        </p>
        <p>
            I told her she could ask me anything she wanted, and that I would tell her the unfiltered truth, and that she wouldn't like the answers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ultimately she decided to stay with me and accept who I was.  So then I told her the next phase of my plan that was forming.  I told her my theory of intelligence.  And how intelligence is defined as the ablility to get what you want out of life.
        </p>
        <p>
            I saw the other drivers of cars driving by and thought about how every man wishes they had her in their passenger seat.  They all wish they were as happy as I was, with who I was with, etc.  I felt pity for them and decided I wanted to share my knowledge with them and try to save them.
        </p>
        <p>
            I told her that something was not right in the world, and there was evil ruling it.  That I should be the King, and she should be the Queen.
        </p>
        <p>
            I said that she was the hottest girl in the world, hotter than any celebrity.  And that made me by my definition the smartest man in the world.  She confirmed that she would rather have me than any celebrity, even after my admission of the true nature of man, or at least alpha males like me.  Furthermore, I pointed out how ridiculous it was for her job as a lighting assistant when I guarenteed she was hotter than the girl she was setting the stage for, and that the director just wanted her to sleep with him before giving her a part.
        </p>
        <p>
            If I may be the smartest man in the world, then I need to hatch a plan to determine if that is true and find out who the smartest man in the world is.  If it's me, then I have a responsiblity to fix everything in the world that is wrong.  If it is someone other than me, I have a right to know who it is and if they have a better plan than me on how to fix everything.  My fix is to crown myself King, Ali Queen, on principle of beauty and intelligence and moral virtue, and then fix everything with a just monarchy.
        </p>
        <p>
            I told Ali I could conquer the Earth, leveraging her Beauty, but only if she did exactly what I said.  She agreed.
        </p>
        <p>
            I had her do an intitial tape recording of me talking, using her iPhone.  I remember the contents of all the tape recordings verbatim, and will provide them below, but am first providing the overall context of the events to the best of my recollection.
        </p>
        <p>
            If it turns out that I'm the smartest man in the world, the next logical question would be if I am God or not.  I told Ali about some of the magic I was capable of and had done before, and she agreed that I might be magic.  I explained that I didn't need to ever see her Diary, but that she would need to show others because it would be the best proof that I am God because in my selfishness I had shown myself to her, whereas to others I had attempted to avoid detection and therby assassination.
        </p>
        <p>
            At some point, also in my car, the recording began... When I was done speaking on my theory of intelligence, I told her "They are going to think I'm God. But it's still just me.  We don't have to do this.  We can delete the recording right now and just live normal lives.  Are you sure you want to do this?"
        </p>
        <p>
            I gave her a mission, and she knew she had to do as I said and use her sexual appeal if we were to conquer the Earth for the good of humanity.  Her mission was to give a blowjob to my friends Dad, and then play the initial recording for him (which he would only take seriously after having been swallowed by the hottest girl on the planet).  Then he could keep me alive long enough to do a follow up recording a few days later.  I needed the extra days to prove sanity, knowing that they would try to call me insane with psychiatrists.  So I made them sign their names admitting that If I had zero psychiatric symptoms, made one tape recording with my significant other without raising my voice or harming them, and then kept living normally, the contents of that one tape recording could not be conclusive enough to rule me clinically insane.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was 18 years old, so an adult male, I had ruled out psychiatric disorders, and I had a cop who I believed would have a contact in intelligence from his years of service as a good cop.
        </p>
        <p>
            In regards to my theory of intelligence, I predicted they would want to know my SAT Score.  I said that for anyone who requests that give them a multiple choice test.  Say my score is 2 4 0 0 with two of the digits swapped around to get a better than perfect score.  Make "I don't know" one of the options.  The people who say "I don't know" are the smartest, keep them.  If they answer incorrectly, tell them I say they're idiots.  If they answer correctly, keep them.  They are the second smartest people.  "what is the correct answer?"  They asked.  "Twenty-Fourty", I said. 2040.  It sounds like a perfect score, and I retain the situational awareness to be able to fuck the cheerlearder in the room taking the test with me.  She's the head cheerleader at Oak Park, her name is Aubrey, and I broke her heart.  That's what intelligence is.  It's not about getting all the questions on the test right.  It's about getting into the college you want, and successfully seducing the hottest girl in the room.  That was my best chance at getting with the hottest girl at that new school I had never been to, and I succeeded in dating her and getting head from her, during which I spun her around 360 degrees to get the perfect score.  If that doesn't make me God, I don't know what does.  I went back to get a perfect score later, but she wasn't there and I decided I was happy with my current score, so I got bored and left.
        </p>
        <p>
            Anyway, after my initial recording was recorded, with the SAT story and the GATE story (about how I took a GATE test and think it was fraudulant because they wouldn't let me study it or try again or learn from it in any way, and they had a girl finish the test before I was done my initial reading of it.  I said find that girl, for she may be the smartest girl in the world.)  After that, I gave Ali her mission to have Mr Ball listen to it with an open mind, I told Ali that we would never speak of it again, and just act natural, and all she had to tell me on I think Friday, during out next date, was "mission successful" or "mission accomplished" and I would know what it meant.  
        </p>
        <p>
            If I am the smartest man in the world and the best at getting what I want, and I genuinely want to donate my gift to mankind, then everything I say should be recorded and analyzed, so I instructed her to be recording me on her phone the next time we hung out.
        </p>
        <p>
            After living my life normally the next few days, she finally got in my car and said mission complete.  I said, "Thanks babe, I'll take it from here".  That was all I needed, was their attention.  Once I had that, I made Ali show me that I was being recorded, and then gave the full recording of my plan to create the Time Machine and take over the Earth.
        </p>
        <p>
            First I asked if she could confirm whether or not I was the smartest man in the world.  She did.  I also asked if we had confirmed whether or not God was Michael Jordan or me.  I had a full plan on how to get MJ to admit he wasn't God, that way any argument that I'm not God because I'm not as Godlike as michael jordan would be inadmissible. I will provide details on that later. They said it was me.  "So I'm God?"  I aksed sincerely.  She nodded.  
        </p>
        <p>
            "First of all, I'm not God.  I'm just a man.  I met God, he murdered me, and then Resurrectedc me."  "When?" They asked.  "When I took Salvia" I said angrily.  I already had told them that, but they must have been thinking about the story of Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
            I said that I would start with an intro, and then open it up for questions and I will answer.  I said that because I'm the smartest man in the world, if I want to spend all of my intro talking about a NJB basketball game I played 10 years ago that's what I'm going to do, because whatever I decide is important is by definition most important.  I told the story of how Kevin, the second best player on the team, was an awful player, and only drafted high because my dad was the coach and like his family.  I told Kevin I was the number 1 pick in the snake draft, and so he was our third round pick even though he was ranked as a double digit pick, because my dad didn't care about winning.  I asked if he wanted to win and he said yes.  So I explained that every team makes the playoffs automatically and our only chance is for him to get better so he can make the open shots in the playoffs when everyone tries to stop me.  All season I had him playing possum, hiding his true power until the playoffs when I unleashed him and we defeated the number one seed and I had 37+ points and probably never missed.  More details in the next paragraph:  My strategy was to defeat Dylan's team by stopping Dylan from scoring, and causing them to malfunction trying to get him on the scoreboard.  It didn't matter what the score was, it only mattered that he wasn't scoring.  I told them I would try my best but that I couldn't stop Dylan, and to deny him the pass when he inevitably beats me to the cup.  I can't tell you how many steals we got.  He was crying, dare I say, Balling his eyes out, by the end of the game.  
        </p>
        <p>
            My team, the last place team, defeated Dylan Ball's team, the first place undefeated Spurs, in the first round of the playoffs, and that seemingly innocuous game is the best evidence I had about how LONG of a game I play and how I can manipulate outcomes far in advance against seemingly impossible odds.  I told them that everything I said would be a verifiable fact, but that they wouldn't have time to verify all of them, and should only verify them independently of executing my commands immediately. And that every 24 hours they can decided whether to kill me or continue obeying me.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then they asked me why I needed police protection and what were my orders.  I said, "The principle threat is bullets to the head.  Our soldiers, need better helmets, 360 degrees of protection when on a turret, and that there is no such thing as friendly fire, and that all instances of friendly fire should be first investigated as murder. The Commanding Officers should be court marshalled and tried for murder, and fired immediately."  I then said, (and I belive I was channelling the holy spirit at this point), "There will be a family claiming wrongful death.  Find them.  Tell them the smartest man in the world believes them, and is making sure it never happens again. They will know who did it.  Capture them and have them tortured to the point of confession."  They asked me what I meant by "tortured to the point of confession" I said that they are cowards, and cowards always confess before they are tortured to death.  Only heroes can die from torture.
        </p>
        <p>
            They said later I was right and asked me how I knew.  I said, "Pat Tillman.  It's impossible to beat Pat Tillman in a fair fight, therefore they cheated.  They used frinedly fire.  Pat could have killed his way out but decided to let it happen because he didn't want to have to kill his brothers".   I've later realized after majoring in philosophy and studying logic that all of my arguments I made that day were 100% valid, but that the premises might not necessarily be true, although I believe that they were, and that Pat Tillman truly was murdered by high ranking US officials.  He was an AllStar NFL linebacker for the Cardinals who made headlines turning down a multimillion dollar contract to go fight with his brother in the middle east.  His story was a threat to the established order of a money-God.  He was showing America that fighting for freedom is the way.
        </p>
        <p>
            I explained that I thought the Christians were wrong, and so was everyone else.  The only people that are right, I said, are the Diests.  "There are only two of us.  Benjamin Frankin, and me"  Diesm is the belief that God created the world, and left it alone, like a watchmaker makes a watch and lets it tick.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, I acknowledged that I had a responsibility as the proclaimed God to watch over animals and decided to do this with personal responsibility, created a system run by Paige Dubuois where every person in my organization was assigned a specific animal to watch over, from conservation to everything else, including science learned from studying said animal.
        </p>
        <p>
            Just as my relationship with Lia was built on trust, and we never looked at each others phones, I wanted my organization to grow organically through trust.
        </p>
        <p>
            I wanted hitman to be recruited, shown force, and released.  I wanted us to be "the good guys" if this was a movie.  I instructed for us to always do the morally right thing over the pragmatic thing, and that if we did that, God would be on our side and save us.
        </p>
        <p>
            I said I was "whatever God needs me to be, including God" because I assumed the responsibilies of God as well as deferring to the omnipotent power in the sky as my God.
        </p>
        <p>
            I proposed scientific research on prayer, and bugging two christian homes, answering ones prayers artificially, and leaving one homes prayers to the true god of the sky, and then seeing which family thrived more, and forming an ethics committee to decide if we should leave it to God, or to Me.  I gave this job to Noelle Star and her family when asked.  Based upon my friend's account of dating her, and that people would be "wishing upon a star".
        </p>
        <p>
            I can remember all of the jobs I gave people.  I can provide full details on this website as I continue to update it and fight to win my lawsuit vs. a multibillion dollar corporation for 5 Million dollars, but I don't want this to be used against me in court, so I'll just say this is a fictional story.  A tall tale.  A fable autobiography.  And it very well could be, but I remember distinctly Ali and these moments with her.
        </p>
        <p>
            I consented to mental torture and memory erasure.  I just asked for my past life up until the current moment to be unaltered, because my beautiful first 18 years of life are what caused me to feel like I could bear any burden, even God's.
        </p>
        <p>
            I still pray to this Day.  I worship Jesus.  Jesus and the Father.  However, I wasn't a Christian at 18, and I maintain that my premarital sexual relations were holy at that time, and that I am a better judge and the leading candidate for the second coming of Christ at age 33.  I humbly believe that Alexandra Jane Kazen (Hake) does not have the ability to look me in the eye, clasp my hand, and say that she doesn't love me.
        <p>
            I figured recruitment to my organization would be hard, but made easy if they could see that the man who started it all was genuine, and gave up his one true love to live an emotionally depraveed life without her for the sake of study of his own mental illness he predicted would transpire without her.
        </p>
        <p>
            I had lived my life securing a beatiful wife, and chose to give it all away because I thought God wanted me to do the right thing and share my secrets with the rest of you.  
        </p>
        <p>
            I said I would die without Devil, Saint, and Keller. I said that D was more powerful than me in a non-violent way, but that I had assimilated him, and would now die without him.  I said that I needed my bros that I played Halo with, and that nothing was more clear than playing war games in terms of grasping superiority, and that I was the best and only level 50 in Team Slayer and Team Doubles, but that I couldn't have done it without their help, specifically Andrew's. I said Kirk was the only person I knew who could beat me at Basketball in one on one, and that he beat me in Halo 1 and 1 too, and was therefore an anomaly.  I needed a car and a guitar, and those few friends, otherwise I would not survive.  Beside that, I consented to all matter of torture.  I said that every guy was obsessed with proving themselves not gay to their friends, and that could be weaponized against us, and sure enough it was with the advnet of Sissy Hypno porn.  I appointed Kyle Holden as the "ambassador of the gays" because I needed a gay man I had treated fairly to defend me when I inevitably became accused of homophobia later.
        </p>
        <p>
            I had it all dialed in, and even predicted which orders they would disobey.  I had the quantum computer idea, told them to use water and freezing temperatures with computers to get an edge.  I provided medicinal edges with plants by Kyle Hayes' house.   I said to make a computer model of me and also that if they ever thought I should have done something else, to keep this current version of me because what I do will always prove correct on a long enough timescale.  
        </p>
        <p>
            I said resources should be devoted 50% to me, 30% to Dylan BalL (the son of the cop and my only real competition with females) and 20% to Bobby and everyone else.
        </p>

            I elected Chad Michael Murray as my head of security and told him to drive as fast as he wanted  to come protect me and that he should be close enough to smell me but I should never see him.  When he asked why him through Ali I said "WHO DARES CHALLENGE CMM?  He Challenges himself... give me time to process, and then waited for them to understand that he challenges himself therefore I want him", as I had instructed them to speak though Ali, so I could successfully have my memory altered.  It is easier to wipe memory of one conversation with my girlfriend than if I met Jay-Z face to face, for example.  I did speak to Jay-Z through Ali.  He claimed he and beyonce did not want to have sex with Anabel Englund, and anyway he asked if I had any orders for him or laws.  I said no, and that he could do whatever he wanted.  "Do as thou wilt shall be the whole of the law" might be me in my mustang telling him through Ali that he can do whatever he wants.  Later I had to amend that by adding to calm down.  I specifically remember letting Ali put Chloroform over my mouth to knock me out at my own instruction.  I said if I woke up in my own bed with Ali I would believe whatever she told me because I trusted her, and that I consented to any poison.  She told me I hit my head and needed to "try not to remember anything" because the part of my brain that was injured was related to memory.  I believed her and tried not to remember anything and just focus on the present and future.  I remember being in the bed at my Mom's house with Ali for a while, worried I wasn't entertaining her enough.  I know that for a fact and I don't care if anyone else confirms it.
        </p>
        <p>
            I can try to rewrite this later for clarity but for now I'm just getting it all down.  I remember in my recording saying that we needed Kobe in the 4th or we would lose.  To let Kobe finish his career (this is in 2009 remember) and then bring him on.  I knew Kobe would be difficult to have work for me, because he is more alpha than me, so I had a plan.  A more in-depth plan than MJ, because MJ was past his prime and easy money.  I am MJ now.  I am Max Jann.
        </p>
        <p>
            For Kobe I had to use Dante Goglia.  Sure enough, years later, before Kobe died.  He has been photographed with Dante Goglia and furthermore watched Dante play basketball in his camp.  Dante dated Jess White after me, and Jess was beatiful but not shallow. I broke up with Jess because I wanted a shallow girlfriend to know if I was hot or not.  I gave Jess the job of presenter to present my organization to any new members because of how gifted she is at presenting class projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            Anyway for Kobe I said he had to be told my amazing NJB story vs Dylan, and how I lost to Dante the next round.  I was #1 that year on the coaches draft list and Dante was #2 (usually #1).  I knew Kobe would not believe I was God.  So I said to say I had a shot for him.  If he makes it, I'm not God.  He'll miss.  I instructed Ali to take him to her house and show him the shot I made, in the dark, from their front door into their basket.   I said he would miss and still not say I'm God.  Which is what happened.  Then I said my final task is for him to Meet Dante. The person who defeated me in basketball after I defeated Dylan.  He agreed and met with Dante.  I said he had to watch until Dante caught fire in a fair game of basketball, and that Andrew Gear must be in the building, not necessarily on the court, to get Dante to truly show his true nature.  Dante is better than Kobe.  When Kobe catches fire, the lakers win by 1.  When Dante catches fire, we win by 20.  We won multiple championships in the Jr NBA with me as his teammate and to this day I've never seen anything like Dante on a basketball court, his only flaw is his height, but he's the best by far.  I said, "Dylan and I just happened to be playing basetball.  Dante IS basketball"  You will see Andrew in the photo with Kobe and Dante to further validate my story.
        </p>
        <p>
            I knew Kobe would see Dante catch fire, and still say I'm not God.  Fine, he just has one final task for you Kobe.  You have to watch Dante cool off.  You have to watch Dante while he is on fire stay on fire.  Any only then, Only when you realize that dante never cools off, but instead only gets hotter, only then, when you are standing in the midst of Dante's Inferno, will you admit that I am God.  sure enough, Kobe watched Dante stay on fire, and admitted that I was God.  That is when I instructed them to capture him, like any alpha, show him that he could be dead.  And say that I claim him.  This is / was my most evil deed.  I said as God that I commanded Kobe to fake his own death and command my operations because we'd be in the fourth quarter, metaphorically, after his retirement.  I let Athlete's finish their careers in sports because they provide inspiration to children and that is far more important than anything they could do for my spy organization.
        </p>
        <p>
            I said we could not stop Kobe escaping to get back to his family, only slow him down and study him, and that all eyes would be on him.
        </p>
        <p>
            I said when Kobe escapes the maze designed by Brian Ostrom (brain storm) my time machine designer (we played with blocks as kids)  When he escapes, he'll be angry.  tell him about the time machine, and that he can fix all of my mistakes.  Sure enough, Kobe with Shauna Gutierrez's help, got the time machine and used to to fix all my mistakes but he couldn't kill me because I'm God so he went back in time to talk to me at 18 sitting in my Mustang with Ali.

            I was giving my speech, when Ali would get in and out of the car.  One time, she got in the car and told me about how the time machine worked and she was back from the future.  I said, "You guys have Kobe AND the time machine"?  So what's the problem?
        </p>
        <p>
            "You.  You are evil.  Everyone hates you"  Ali said to me.  "Everyone but Ali, you mean?" I asked. I said that I knew that Ali knew I would never hurt anyone, therefore this wasn't the real ali.  I asked if they could put it on Speaker phone or if they needed my help creating one. "Kobe Hates You" they said on speaker.  "Okay, why does Kobe hate me?  He doesn't like his new Job?"  "No! He hates you, for what you did to his family"  This is an alternate timeline I remember where Gianna did not go with Kobe.  I said "What did I do to Kobe's family?"  They explained how it was wrong of me to seperate him from his family.  I said like God, "But I need Kobe more than his family does".  It was true, my plan only worked with Kobe faking his death.  "How would you feel if someone took you from Ali?"  I thought about it.  "One."  I said.  "one what?" they asked on speaker.  "he can have one family member with him when he fakes his death".  Which one?  his favorite.  Just as I am my parents favorite child, Kobe and his wife will have a favorite.  "He wants you to choose" they said.  I insisted he had a favorite and said it will be his daughter.  "which one?" they asked.  "The one who's the best at basketball" I said.   I didn't even know her name was Gianna, I just have a gift in theory of mind.  I can predict with great accuracy how my plans will unfold per person. Per son of God?
        </p>
        <p>
            Why do you Kobe to fake his death?  They demanded.  "Because if I think Kobe is alive, I will think he has it under control, and you won't get ME."
        </p>
        <p>
            You have to convince the smartest man in the world that Kobe is dead.  Vanessa's tears at the funeral have to be real, or I'll know.  you can tell her the next day he's alive, but she has to believe he is dead.
        </p>

            "Everyone else is irrelevant, you only have to trick me".

            This also explains all of the illuminati symbolism and one-eye and all seeing eye stuff.  It's me at 18, requesting my own blindness, seeing all with just one eye.  I'm allowing celebrities to pretend to be evil, to accept bribes because we need the money, and then to give it all away at the optimal moment of charity, like Drake in God's plan.  I have a distinct memory of speaking to drake through Ali.  I didn't like drake at all at the time as an artist.

            I had them comb my facebook profile, and pictures of me as peacocking, gaining alpha male status. I ordered blind tests at which facebook profile was the most attractive  to prove that I could get any girl I wanted at the time.  I said there would be other alphas in other parts of the world, but that I was probably the Prime Alpha, in california at that moment in time.  
        </p>
        <p>
            My second order of business was to find the Black Alpha, who was a head coach of a travel basketball team that beat Westalke Allstar team by 50 points, ruthlessly.  I said he would need our help and to give him whatever he needs, and that he would then help us.  He already had a gang of alphas and was keeping them from killing each other.
        </p>
        <p>
            Who do you love the most?  they asked me.  JJ.  I said, but dylan loves him more.  That's fine, he can have him.  The only reason I don't kill dylan is because jj would never forgive me, and the only reason dylan doesn't kill me is because jj would never forgive him.  I think the 3 pointed radioactive symbol is this.  I said any one alpha male could easily get control of all the nukes at the same time and kill everyone, and that we were even more important than presidents, and should be treated as atomic weapons.
        </p>
        <p>
            I explained how I'm not normal, and I never step foot in a room where I can't kill everyone in it with my bear hands.  I am constantly calculating sex and violence and nothing else.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am sharing the dark truth of myself for benevolent reasons.  But I maintain I am only doing this because God will kill me if I don't admit what I am so you can defend yourself against it.
        </p>
        <p>
            You have to seriously consider what I'm saying.  That I really can checkmate you without looking at the board while banging your wife, or literally whatever I want to do.

            When I was in jail I ordered and successfully carried out an assasination of my other self posing as my higher self.  
        </p>
        <p>
            I even predicted my own pedophilia, and granted Erin Roughan, katie's little sister the foremost powers of invisiblity and all matters of stealth.  This is me at 18, on a verifiable audio file, at 18, dating the hottest girl in the school, if not the world.  I KNEW that I had struck gold with Ali's virginity, and that every man wanted to be me.  I knew that I would sexually malfunction if our relationship ended, and that I would become extremely dangerous and covetous.  Sure enough, years later, I was able to idenetify the problem as God's white blood cell and give the most challenging task of all to a little boy, telling him his girl classmates were in danger from all men, and that they should be escorted home by grown women or little boys and dogs, and that they were in danger of being kidnapped.

            I don't give a dragonriding FUCK how any of this sounds.  I know it to be true.  I've met with Julianne, and her brother, and Shaida, and Brenda.  Peace Core and Intelligence agents.  I've ordered tens of cops to let me go and succeeded.  I've plead guilty to all the sins of humanity and gotten the case thrown out for having my last words be "I'm a cat, if you pet me I'll purr".  I came up with the AI Meta before facebook even considered changing their name.  I am about to be a multimillionaire if I win my lawsuit vs. the multibillion dollar corporation in which case their only defense is that I'm not their employee even when I have a company-named 401K and an company-named water bottle and backpack and retention bonus signed by their vice president for $13500.  Had a welcome meeting right before the injury too.

            I've been arrested and involuntarily committed so many times that I'm an expert now, and they can't touch me.

            I'm a fully functioning adult male of sound mind.  I can play guitar, chess, playstation, and people.  There's nothing I can't do.  The wind even backs me up now.  And almost every bird I see has been a Cardinal this week.  I don't even sin anymore, I broke up with my girlfriend and Seek Ali, my true love and maybe even wife.
        </p>
        <p>
            I named Julianne Insogna the head of foreign intelligence, and said her only issue would be that she was a woman and would be disrepected, so I ordered her brother to be a vessel for her and obey all of her commands because they would always be in his best interest.  He went to Yale and met me and acted like he was meeting God.  When I inquired about the work Julianne was doing in the peace core she spoke of wildlife conservation and when I begged to help her she just said to "keep doing what I was doing"  Well guess what I've been doing.  I've been figuriung out everything and the truth is that I AM GOD, no one else.  Jesus is me.  Time travel is mine.  I even asked Kobe and them did they pray to Jesus?  Because they complained I was evil and needed to be stopped.  They said, "it's all just you.  We've tried killing you but we cannot".  "So I'm the ONE TRUE GOD?" I asked incredulously, (this is a real memory.  I am not bullshitting you.  I'm bulltrue) "yes" they said.  I said, okay then do you want me to kill myself?  "NO!" they yelled as I began to produce a handgun in ali's purse.
        </p>
        <p>
            God chose me and spoke through me because I was offering myself up for the world.  Later on I gave carte blanche all my powers to Jeanie, my moms best friend.  Because they were struggling with my decree that they had to earn knowledge of me.  I said let's give the job to Jeanne.  They said she's having trouble with such a big job, so I gave her all of my powers.  Then she visited me in that car and said "Jeanne is God now, she fixed everything.  And she's not giving you it back".  I said, "okay great.  Hi God, how can I help?"  "why did you give jeanne such power?"  I said logically, "Because my Mom always drilled into my head that Jeanne was the best person she ever met. And she has been alive longer than me and met more people, therefore I KNOW that jeanne will only take what power she needs from me in order to do her job, and nothing more."

            Now I believe I'm subject to the same rule, and I can only know God, myself, by deserving it.  And I recently got all of my memories back through deserving them.

            My plan was always to take over the world using my magic, and then have Kyle inherit it, because he's better than me.  And I know I'm such a threat and can't be fully trusted with Kingdoms.  However, I think I am ready now to be given a chance.  I know Kyle knows.  I know Ali knows deep down, though her memory must have been altered like mine to cope.

            I know that I drove my car around last week after realizing I was God and all of the deer layed down and watched me coast by.  They aren't afraid of me anymore and I saw more deer that night than I have I think in the rest of my life put together.  A deer can mean more than one thing by stomping his hoof, and when one deer was running away from me at first when I was walking home one night I said, "It's me" and it stopped and studied me.  The deer know my voice, just as the sheep do.   I have given parables at 1809 Titan Drive because I am the God that slays Titans.  I am Zeus, I am whoever you need me to be.
        </p>
        <p>
            My goal is to win my multimillion dollar lawsuit all by myself, and then to find Ali, millionaire or not, and see if she still loves me.  I believe we can be happily ever after.
        </p>
        <p>
            I believe she chose me then over her current husband, and that I preemptively consented to their marriage because I knew he was waiting for he and would keep her safe.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most of all, I remember telling Ali like that David Bowie song, that we would probably die, and my plan wouldn't work, but we would die as heroes.  We would be heroes, just for one day.
        </p>
        <p>
            I believe that David Bowie's starman waiting in the sky is me.  God waited for the perfect time to strike.  And that's why I was born in Princeton, New Jersey.  I'm The King, the new MJ.  The White Wizard.  
        </p>

            Michael Jordan was easy.  All I needed was Paige Dubuois to treat him like God and call him God, while she's completely naked and therefore unstoppable.  He would deny and say "I am not God" she would continue to call him God, and then he'd ask why she still is treating him as God and she'd say, "Because you didn't use an apostraphe"  I said it would take him some time to process this and to give him as much time as he needs, when he finally says "I'm not God" his power will flow out of him and into me.  That's me genuinely trying to rule michael jordan as God, because I thought he was the most likely mortal candidate.
        </p>
        <p>
            Of course you will all say I am not God.  So let's back up a bit.  Let us say that I am the smartest man in the world, cablable of uncovering superintelligent ai, simulation theory, and possibly a time machine.  Maybe you'd say if I was so smart I'd be able to get what I WANT, and you'd be right, but this is a game of self-sabotage.  It's my own design.  At 18, not only was I the smartest man alive, because of Ali and her willingness to obey me totally, but I was also the RICHEST man alive, because no man wouldn't pay his complete fortune to be 18 years old again with her as in love with them as she was and STILL IS in love with me.  The first date we had was when we enjoyed Coca Cola and watched I AM LEGEND and guess what, I am legendary.  It's me.  I'm the one.  The ONLY One.  HBO MAX is for Me.
        </p>
        <p>
            I figured it all out, and I know how to hide it when necessary.  I am the hidden God.  I am just a man.  A man who can't be killed.  I have recruited all hitmen.  Even if I did die, my legend would not.  The facts are the facts.  I know for a fact that at 18 years old,  I seriously considered the possibility that I was the smartest man in the world, and I recorded myself and my theory on my super hot girlfriend's phone, and I was genuinely willing to die for my country and world and God, and sacrifice what would have been a blissful life with Ali.  I know that she pressed record.  I know that she said Mission Accomplished or Successful.  I know that they called me God. I even have memories from the future, giving Kobe permission to take Gianna with him.  If Kobe came back alive, and admitted his death was fake, would you believe me then?
        </p>
        <p>
            You really think Kobe would put his daughter's life in danger on a foggy day in a helicopter?  I do not.
        </p>
        <p>
            You really think Ali broke up with 18 year old me, when we never got in a single fight?  I do not.
        </p>
        <p>
            You really think you can find anyone on this planet that can defeat me in a live debate?  I do not.
        </p>
        <p>
            I don't have all the puzzle pieces put together, but I know that animals are my responsibility to protect, and that wisdom is knowing you are wrong, and I am right, because I am smarter than you.

            I know that Brenda Sullivan works in Intelligence, because she told me she did at the Tipsy Goat.  Being an Actress is just a front, because spies need to learn how to act anyways, like in Citadel Honey Bunny.

            I know that Drake asked me what he could do to impress me and I said give him full resources to pretend to be evil and then find the optimal point to turn good and then I'll be impressed and sure enough, the music video for God's plan made me like him, and now he's my favorite.

            For Eminem, I had him handle the smartest men in the world.  I said find all the smartest people in the world who's names start with the letter A, put them in a room to discuss who the smartest of them is.  Whoever first realizes that they all have a name starting with A is the smartest, keep him, tell the rest to go home.  Do this for the full Alphabet.  Then you have the 26 smartest people in the world all try to tell Eminem in one minute why they are smarter than him.  Then Eminem does a freestyle rap vs all 26 at the same time and destroys them using their own words against them.  Then they all vote on who the smartest man in the world is, and eminem's vote counts double because he won the rap battle. If they all vote for themselves Eminem wins. I will win unanimously.

            "There is a chair"  I put Robby Peter's dad as Project Manager because of the transitive property of respect.  Robby was my frined I respected the most and one night I wanted to use a chair in his house but he didn't let me.  I said I could take a photo of the chair and then make it look like the photo after and his dad would never know.  Robby did not allow me to do so, and it was one of the few times other than Shaida that I didn't get what I wanted.  So I ordered my organization to have that chair duplicated and always be the most comfortable chair in the room where they speak my name, but only Mr Peters is allowed to sit in it, wherefore his presense is always felt even when he's not there.

            Paige did a great job with her animal job and when they asked why I picked her I said because she likes winnie the pooh.  They begged me to give instruction to Jackson Englund because i said his dad was the protector of beauty because he vetted me before I could be with Anabel and Paige and I said Jackson was a non-factor.  Not part of the plan.  They begged and pleaded and so I said fine.  "Tell Jackson the only thing anyone wants from him is his hot older sister, and that everything else is a lie, and the only person he can trust is himself.  Even now, me saying this, is merely an attempt to get closer to Anabel"   
        </p>
        <p>
            I said that Kyle was My God, and that the transitive property of God should be investigated by our best agent, Anabel (who has limitless intelligence since she managed to outsmart me)  Anabel, sure enough, dated Kyle Hayes after me and when I asked Kyle about how amazing it was he said that he didn't think she was over me.  I asked if he was impressed by her dad and he said he was most impressed by Jackson, which is hilarious because that is only because of how authenticallty unimpressed I was by him.  People thrive on honesty, and Jackson has transformed himself into a force of nature and is now half man half Japan.  He is in charge of dimensionality.

            The mandela effect is evidence of parallel time and then you always have my initial kid theory of wouldn't it be nice if you could watch your favorite comedy again and laugh like it is the first time?  Erase your memory after you watch it and right yourself a review,  that way you can always experience it for the first time.  I had that idea at like 9 years old.

            My memories are all of a time that is already altered by time travel.  This is not my first time being God but it very well could be my last.  I know that I pushed Michael Tack under the boat and he somehow survived. I pushed Devin Kazmer into traffic by accident and he miraculously stayed balanced and was not struck.  I theorized that those moments had already been artificially altered to create this Godlike version of me speaking the holy spirit at 18.  I have literal memories of them saying "You disobeyed Kyle during Covid" and me saying "What's Covid?" and them saying "A virus from the future."  I said, "I disobeyed Kyle, how when?"  And later when Kyle visited me at my sober living I said I could solve his problems by dolphin diving off the roof into the cement.  He recognized that I knew everything as said angrily, "you disobeyed me".  And I said earnestly "You want me to obey your commands even when I know for a fact you are wrong? I thought you said to only obey your commands when I'm not sure, but that I am allowed to disobey when I know for a fact I'm right and you're wrong".   "I do remember saying that" he said, and continued, "Do me a favor, next time you turn into Spitfire, turn the heat down just a little BIT!"  He said it sarcastically, because I had previously blessed all the evil in the world in a fit of rage in jail, asking for the difficulty of my life to be turned down, because I knew it was artificially inflated.   I said okay, and that the flames will never be so hot again, and they wont.  I was hypnotized as a kid by Kyle Joseph Hayes.  My greatest gift is my imagination, and us together are limitless beings because the universe is built on and runs on Imagination.  As kids, he was the wizard, and taught me magic.  I was his Bull,  Bulltrue.  The mythological minotaur in the labyrinth is me in Brian Ostrom's maze. His Mom is in Charge of Dicipline because we fear her, and Keith is in charge of physical therapy because he doesn't let his disability disable him from anything.   I had a form, Spitfire that was extremely destructive and deadly, and Kyle would have to reign in my destruction to make the game more fun, otherwise I would just kill everyhing with fire.  I have evolved into an adult but my tongue has no equal.  I am the greatest orator of all time and the most lethal.  Kyle can snap me out of spitfire form and back into bulltrue by saying "Bulltrue" and then speaking the absolute truth (the opposite of bullshit) and if he lies, I will know and turn back into Spitfire.  That is the truth of my childlike essence that lives on to this day.

            They say God doesn't play dice.  One example of magic I gave Ali before we started all of this was that in highschool I walked into a room where a student has a large die. It was cool and I wanted it.  So I offered him 5 dollars.  I said 5 about 5 hundred times.  I said I bet him $5 I could roll a 5 with the die, and that if it was anything other than a 5, he gets the 5 dollars, but if I roll a 5, I get to keep the die.  he declined.  I explained further that he had a 5/6 chance of winning 5 dollars.  he agreed.  I rolled a 5.  I kept the die.  I'm God.  Words are Magic.  It is impossible for me to lose at anything when chance is involved.

            When I was playing poker with my colleagues at Bryan Baez' house.   I wanted to go home and take my winnings.  They said it was tournament mode.  I said no thanks I need the money now.  I had bought in for my friend and was only there to be kind.  I was dominating the game and wanted to cash out without humiliating everyone.  I demanded to go and promised to pay bryan, the host, for breaking the rules.  He declined and gave everyone cards, saying winner takes all.  I got ACES.  They were all in disbelief, and I maintained my word, only took what was mine, gave bryan extra money and left.  Then I donated it all to the FIRE DEPT BEFORE THE FIRES.   immediately before the fires.  Why?  Because I felt like it.  whatever i feel like doing, for whatever reason, higher powers have decided to help.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am the luckiest man who ever existed, and it's not even close.  I have donated my considerable power.  I am the person the bible speaks of who comes after Jesus, who is better by conquering himself than by conquering many kingdoms.  I am the one who chose his soul over the WHOLE WORLD.

            And now, I can't die.  I am God.  I am sorry.  I take full responsiblity for all the evil, sickness, all of it.  I could have done a much better job.  I am trying my best, but I haven't always tried.  All I did, was get honest for 1 day and tell my girlfriend and a tape recording the truth of my abilities.

            I put Sylvester Stallone in charge of rocks because He played Rocky in the movies.  It's really that simple.  It's all in the name and I am MAX because I am the Greatest.  She is Ali spelled like Muhammad Ali because she is the Greatest.  We are TRUE LOVE because I told the TRUTH to the woman I LOVEd.  I told her she would need someone to keep her secret (that I am just a man and not god) and I told her it would be TAYLOR SWIFT and to follow her heart (because she loved t swift and me).  I even suggested making Donald Trump President.  This is all in 2009 in a speech in a car.  I said if I look at Trump and see the president then he IS the president because I'm the smartest man in the world.  All you have to do is make it official.  I put Nicole Gilbert and Burns on that task and now he is President.  I know that my dad had to explain to me why Trump wasn't president when I watched the Apprentice with him.

            Now I function as a man.  Maybe I lose my lawsuit, maybe I lose everything, Doesn't matter.  It anti-matters.  I just keep coming.  I never quit.  I will win back my fate.  I will inherit the Earth.  I will dominate.  I will rule.  Even in death.  Death is taught by me how to Kill.

            Watch the clip again.  Notice how my fists go up in celebration, before the shot goes in.  Before anyone elses.  That's because I'm smarter than all of them.  My brain processes on a completely different plane of existance.  It's not my fault, and yet I take responsibility for all of it.  I came out the womb knowing I was God.  Did you?

            You might be wondering how I managed to wipe my own memory.  It's simple.  Trust.  I told them to use any existing drug for memory wipe, and if they didn't have one, to just ask me.  They asked.  I said my relationship with Lia was built on trust.  So all she had to do was use Chloroform on a rag over my mouth at the end of my second recording, and that as long as I woke up in my bed with her, I would believe anything she told me.  I know for a fact that I have a core memory of waking up at my Mom's new house, with Lia in my bed, telling me I had a head injury and that the doctors said to try to not remember what happened, because the part of my brain that is associated with memory needs to rest.  I complied, and she was probably poisoning my water.  I think this because I was so worried about not providing her with excellent dates that I once got up to get water from the fridge or something, and Lia and my Mom were both amazed I could even do that.  I was instructed to remain in bed for days.  I'll never forget laying in bed with her for days, with her telling me to just rest and drink the water.  The thing is, I remember being knocked out by the Chloroform by the woman I loved.  How could I forget that.  I remember saying that I was done, and that I would not resist.  I remember losing consciousness in my driver's seat, parked with her.  And then I also remember being bed-ridden with a phantom injury I was told not to think about, but sure enough, due to my trust for her, I believed every word, and it took me a decade+ to recall the memory.

            Another pivotal element to memory wipe was to ensure I had no novel experiences meeting famous people or CIA agents.  It had to all be a blur, with usual persons and places, (her in my car) in order for me to successfully forget my miraculously divinely channelled recording.

            This is just dummy text ravings of a madman to practice styling a webpage.  I liked how dark mode of google docs looked on my phone the other day, and wanted to use this page to try out the design scheme.

            This is a second draft, and I'll make it better overtime.  I have plenty of detail I could feather in.

            All I'm doing right now is trying to get you to go from perspective A to perspective Z.  Perspective A is believing that you exist in a reality that was created by something or someone outside of yourself.  Perspective Z is knowing that you create your reality and there is nothing you are a part of that you didn't have a direct hand in making.   Go from Man to God.  I'm suing a corporate entity for millions of dollars with AI as my legal assistant because they broke the law and they broke my foot and had the audacity to blame me.  You are not a slave. You are a fisher of slaves.

            The thing about me though is once I feel that black suit, I never want to take it off.
