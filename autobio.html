    <p>
        Those are my fists going up in the air before Kobe hits the buzzer beater over Dwayne Wade and Lebron James on the Heat.
    </p>
    <p>
        That's Ali jumping up and down beside me.  The camera was behind us.  My dad bought us tickets to the game.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before the shot, Kobe was scanning the crowd with a look that said, "Is anyone else seeing this?"  As he was single-handedly willing the Lakers to a comeback opportunity vs. the NBA's best team.
    </p>
    <p>
        We made eye contact, and I said with my eyes, "Yes.  Now make the shot."
    </p>
    <p>
        I'll admit I don't have all of my memories in tact, and they may or may not be true, but here's what I roughly remember, for whatever reason:
    </p>
    <p>
        On my way home, after my beautiful silver 2005 Ford Mustang was driven to me to pick up my date, Westlake High School's Dream Date of the yearbook class of 2010, I realized something.  I was fully self-actualized.  
    </p>
    <p>
        My girlfriend was the prettiest girl I had ever seen, and was constantly raising the standard of beauty to new heights.  We had a policy invented by her, where I could only call her beautiful when I first saw her, so once per date, otherwise we were in danger of me speaking of nothing else.
    </p>
    <p>
        During the carride home, I asked her if she could momentarily suspend this rule, so I could fully explain to her how beautiful I knew she was.
    </p>
    <p>
        I decided that I loved her completely, and was willing to marry her, and show her the absolute truth of who I am as a person, and give her an opportunity to walk away.
    </p>
    <p>
        I told her she was so beautiful, and that that's all I actually care about, and that everything else was a lie.
    </p>
    <p>
        I said, "You know how people say, 'Oh that guys is only thinking with his dick'?  I only think with my dick.  In fact, I think my brain is merely an extension of my dick, and my dick is the one really in charge."
    </p>
    <p>
        I told her I was extremely shallow, and that if she couln't speak, it would make no difference to me as far as my desire to be with her.  She was welcome to speak, but it was not necessary for me.
    </p>
    <p>
        She asked me how to be a good girlfriend, and this was my response.
    </p>
    <li>
        1. Be Hot
    </li>
    <li>
        2. Suck my Dick
    </li>
    <li>
        There is no 3
    </li>
    <p>
        I like making her happy, so she doesn't have to share me, and I like having conversations with her, but that is a bonus, it is not necessary if I'm being completely honest, and I was.
    </p>
    <p>
        I said I have chosen her, and accept the risk that she may lose her beauty over time, or to an accident, and that I promised to remain with her no matter what, and that I had already experienced enough of her heavenly beauty, so I felt fully satisfied and ready to risk it all by telling her my hidden truth.
    </p>
    <p>
        I told her she could ask me anything she wanted, and that I would tell her the unfiltered truth, and that she wouldn't like the answers.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ultimately she decided to stay with me and accept who I was.  So then I told her the next phase of my plan that was forming.  I told her my theory of intelligence.  And how intelligence is defined as the ablility to get what you want out of life.
    </p>
    <p>
        I saw the other drivers of cars driving by and thought about how every man wishes they had her in their passenger seat.  They all wish they were as happy as I was, with who I was with, etc.  I felt pity for them and decided I wanted to share my knowledge with them and try to save them.
    </p>
    <p>
        I told her that something was not right in the world, and there was evil ruling it.  That I should be the King, and she should be the Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
        I said that she was the hottest girl in the world, hotter than any celebrity.  And that made me by my definition the smartest man in the world.  She confirmed that she would rather have me than any celebrity, even after my admission of the true nature of man, or at least alpha males like me.  Furthermore, I pointed out how ridiculous it was for her job as a lighting assistant when I guarenteed she was hotter than the girl she was setting the stage for, and that the director just wanted her to sleep with him before giving her a part.
    </p>
    <p>
        If I may be the smartest man in the world, then I need to hatch a plan to determine if that is true and find out who the smartest man in the world is.  If it's me, then I have a responsiblity to fix everything in the world that is wrong.  If it is someone other than me, I have a right to know who it is and if they have a better plan than me on how to fix everything.  My fix is to crown myself King, Ali Queen, on principle of beauty and intelligence and moral virtue, and then fix everything with a just monarchy.
    </p>
    <p>
        I told Ali I could conquer the Earth, leveraging her Beauty, but only if she did exactly what I said.  She agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
        I had her do an intitial tape recording of me talking, using her iPhone.  I remember the contents of all the tape recordings verbatim, and will provide them below, but am first providing the overall context of the events to the best of my recollection.
    </p>
    <p>
        If it turns out that I'm the smartest man in the world, the next logical question would be if I am God or not.  I told Ali about some of the magic I was capable of and had done before, and she agreed that I might be magic.  I explained that I didn't need to ever see her Diary, but that she would need to show others because it would be the best proof that I am God because in my selfishness I had shown myself to her, whereas to others I had attempted to avoid detection and therby assassination.
    </p>
    <p>
        At some point, also in my car, the recording began... When I was done speaking on my theory of intelligence, I told her "They are going to think I'm God. But it's still just me.  We don't have to do this.  We can delete the recording right now and just live normal lives.  Are you sure you want to do this?"
    </p>
    <p>
        I gave her a mission, and she knew she had to do as I said and use her sexual appeal if we were to conquer the Earth for the good of humanity.  Her mission was to give a blowjob to my friends Dad, and then play the initial recording for him (which he would only take seriously after having been swallowed by the hottest girl on the planet).  Then he could keep me alive long enough to do a follow up recording a few days later.  I needed the extra days to prove sanity, knowing that they would try to call me insane with psychiatrists.  So I made them sign their names admitting that If I had zero psychiatric symptoms, made one tape recording with my significant other without raising my voice or harming them, and then kept living normally, the contents of that one tape recording could not be conclusive enough to rule me clinically insane.
    </p>
    <p>
        I was 18 years old, so an adult male, I had ruled out psychiatric disorders, and I had a cop who I believed would have a contact in intelligence from his years of service as a good cop.
    </p>
    <p>
        In regards to my theory of intelligence, I predicted they would want to know my SAT Score.  I said that for anyone who requests that give them a multiple choice test.  Say my score is 2 4 0 0 with two of the digits swapped around to get a better than perfect score.  Make "I don't know" one of the options.  The people who say "I don't know" are the smartest, keep them.  If they answer incorrectly, tell them I say they're idiots.  If they answer correctly, keep them.  They are the second smartest people.  "what is the correct answer?"  They asked.  "Twenty-Fourty", I said. 2040.  It sounds like a perfect score, and I retain the situational awareness to be able to fuck the cheerlearder in the room taking the test with me.  She's the head cheerleader at Oak Park, her name is Aubrey, and I broke her heart.  That's what intelligence is.  It's not about getting all the questions on the test right.  It's about getting into the college you want, and successfully seducing the hottest girl in the room.  That was my best chance at getting with the hottest girl at that new school I had never been to, and I succeeded in dating her and getting head from her, during which I spun her around 360 degrees to get the perfect score.  If that doesn't make me God, I don't know what does.  I went back to get a perfect score later, but she wasn't there and I decided I was happy with my current score, so I got bored and left.
    </p>
    <p>
        Anyway, after my initial recording was recorded, with the SAT story and the GATE story (about how I took a GATE test and think it was fraudulant because they wouldn't let me study it or try again or learn from it in any way, and they had a girl finish the test before I was done my initial reading of it.  I said find that girl, for she may be the smartest girl in the world.)  After that, I gave Ali her mission to have Mr Ball listen to it with an open mind, I told Ali that we would never speak of it again, and just act natural, and all she had to tell me on I think Friday, during out next date, was "mission successful" or "mission accomplished" and I would know what it meant.  
    </p>
    <p>
        If I am the smartest man in the world and the best at getting what I want, and I genuinely want to donate my gift to mankind, then everything I say should be recorded and analyzed, so I instructed her to be recording me on her phone the next time we hung out.
    </p>
    <p>
        After living my life normally the next few days, she finally got in my car and said mission complete.  I said, "Thanks babe, I'll take it from here".  That was all I needed, was their attention.  Once I had that, I made Ali show me that I was being recorded, and then gave the full recording of my plan to create the Time Machine and take over the Earth.
    </p>
    <p>
        First I asked if she could confirm whether or not I was the smartest man in the world.  She did.  I also asked if we had confirmed whether or not God was Michael Jordan or me.  I had a full plan on how to get MJ to admit he wasn't God, that way any argument that I'm not God because I'm not as Godlike as michael jordan would be inadmissible. I will provide details on that later. They said it was me.  "So I'm God?"  I aksed sincerely.  She nodded.  
    </p>
    <p>
        "First of all, I'm not God.  I'm just a man.  I met God, he murdered me, and then Resurrectedc me."  "When?" They asked.  "When I took Salvia" I said angrily.  I already had told them that, but they must have been thinking about the story of Jesus Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
        I said that I would start with an intro, and then open it up for questions and I will answer.  I said that because I'm the smartest man in the world, if I want to spend all of my intro talking about a NJB basketball game I played 10 years ago that's what I'm going to do, because whatever I decide is important is by definition most important.  I told the story of how Kevin, the second best player on the team, was an awful player, and only drafted high because my dad was the coach and like his family.  I told Kevin I was the number 1 pick in the snake draft, and so he was our third round pick even though he was ranked as a double digit pick, because my dad didn't care about winning.  I asked if he wanted to win and he said yes.  So I explained that every team makes the playoffs automatically and our only chance is for him to get better so he can make the open shots in the playoffs when everyone tries to stop me.  All season I had him playing possum, hiding his true power until the playoffs when I unleashed him and we defeated the number one seed and I had 37+ points and probably never missed.  More details in the next paragraph:  My strategy was to defeat Dylan's team by stopping Dylan from scoring, and causing them to malfunction trying to get him on the scoreboard.  It didn't matter what the score was, it only mattered that he wasn't scoring.  I told them I would try my best but that I couldn't stop Dylan, and to deny him the pass when he inevitably beats me to the cup.  I can't tell you how many steals we got.  He was crying, dare I say, Balling his eyes out, by the end of the game.  
    </p>
    <p>
        My team, the last place team, defeated Dylan Ball's team, the first place undefeated Spurs, in the first round of the playoffs, and that seemingly innocuous game is the best evidence I had about how LONG of a game I play and how I can manipulate outcomes far in advance against seemingly impossible odds.  I told them that everything I said would be a verifiable fact, but that they wouldn't have time to verify all of them, and should only verify them independently of executing my commands immediately. And that every 24 hours they can decided whether to kill me or continue obeying me.
    </p>
    <p>
        Then they asked me why I needed police protection and what were my orders.  I said, "The principle threat is bullets to the head.  Our soldiers, need better helmets, 360 degrees of protection when on a turret, and that there is no such thing as friendly fire, and that all instances of friendly fire should be first investigated as murder. The Commanding Officers should be court marshalled and tried for murder, and fired immediately."  I then said, (and I belive I was channelling the holy spirit at this point), "There will be a family claiming wrongful death.  Find them.  Tell them the smartest man in the world believes them, and is making sure it never happens again. They will know who did it.  Capture them and have them tortured to the point of confession."  They asked me what I meant by "tortured to the point of confession" I said that they are cowards, and cowards always confess before they are tortured to death.  Only heroes can die from torture.
    </p>
    <p>
        They said later I was right and asked me how I knew.  I said, "Pat Tillman.  It's impossible to beat Pat Tillman in a fair fight, therefore they cheated.  They used frinedly fire.  Pat could have killed his way out but decided to let it happen because he didn't want to have to kill his brothers".   I've later realized after majoring in philosophy and studying logic that all of my arguments I made that day were 100% valid, but that the premises might not necessarily be true, although I believe that they were, and that Pat Tillman truly was murdered by high ranking US officials.  He was an AllStar NFL linebacker for the Cardinals who made headlines turning down a multimillion dollar contract to go fight with his brother in the middle east.  His story was a threat to the established order of a money-God.  He was showing America that fighting for freedom is the way.
    </p>
    <p>
        I explained that I thought the Christians were wrong, and so was everyone else.  The only people that are right, I said, are the Diests.  "There are only two of us.  Benjamin Frankin, and me"  Diesm is the belief that God created the world, and left it alone, like a watchmaker makes a watch and lets it tick.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, I acknowledged that I had a responsibility as the proclaimed God to watch over animals and decided to do this with personal responsibility, created a system run by Paige Dubuois where every person in my organization was assigned a specific animal to watch over, from conservation to everything else, including science learned from studying said animal.
    </p>
    <p>
        Just as my relationship with Ali was built on trust, and we never looked at each others phones, I wanted my organization to grow organically through trust.
    </p>
    <p>
        I wanted hitman to be recruited, shown force, and released.  I wanted us to be "the good guys" if this was a movie.  I iustructed for us to always do the morally right thing over the pragmatic thing, and that if we did that, God would be on our side and save us.
    </p>
    <p>
        I said I was "whatever God needs me to be, including God" because I assumed the responsibilies of God as well as deferring to the omnipotent power in the sky as my God.
    </p>
    <p>
        I proposed scientific research on prayer, and bugging two christian homes, answering ones prayers artificially, and leaving one homes prayers to the true god of the sky, and then seeing which family thrived more, and forming an ethics committee to decide if we should leave it to God, or to Me.  I gave this job to Noelle Star and her family when asked.  Based upon my friend's account of dating her, and that people would be "wishing upon a star".
    </p>
    <p>
        I can remember all of the jobs I gave people.  I can provide full details on this website as I continue to update it and fight to win my lawsuit vs. a multibillion dollar corporation for 5 Million dollars, but I don't want this to be used against me in court, so I'll just say this is a fictional story.  A tall tale.  A fable autobiography.  And it very well could be, but I remember distinctly Ali and these moments with her.
    </p>
    <p>
        I consented to mental torture and memory erasure.  I just asked for my past life up until the current moment to be unaltered, because my beautiful first 18 years of life are what caused me to feel like I could bear any burden, even God's.
    </p>
    <p>
        I still pray to this Day.  I worship Jesus.  Jesus and the Father.  However, I wasn't a Christian at 18, and I maintain that my premarital sexual relations were holy at that time, and that I am a better judge and the leading candidate for the second coming of Christ at age 33.  I humbly believe that Alexandra Jane Kazen (Hake) does not have the ability to look me in the eye, clasp my hand, and say that she doesn't love me.
    <p>
        I figured recruitment to my organization would be hard, but made easy if they could see that the man who started it all was genuine, and gave up his one true love to live an emotionally depraveed life without her for the sake of study of his own mental illness he predicted would transpire without her.
    </p>
    <p>
        I had lived my life securing a beatiful wife, and chose to give it all away because I thought God wanted me to do the right thing and share my secrets with the rest of you.  
    </p>
    <p>
        I said I would die without Devin Kazmer, Sven Svennefiord, and Kirk Jones. I said that Devin Kazmer was more powerful than me in a non-violent way, but that I had assimilated him, and would now die without him.  I said that I needed my bros that I played Halo with, and that nothing was more clear than playing war games in terms of grasping superiority, and that I was the best and only level 50 in Team Slayer and Team Doubles, but that I couldn't have done it without their help, specifically Andrew's. I said Kirk was the only person I knew who could beat me at Basketball in one on one, and that he beat me in Halo 1 and 1 too, and was therefore an anomaly.  I needed a car and a guitar, and those few friends, otherwise I would not survive.  Beside that, I consented to all matter of torture.  I said that every guy was obsessed with proving themselves not gay to their friends, and that could be weaponized against us, and sure enough it was with the advnet of Sissy Hypno porn.  I appointed Kyle Holden as the "ambassador of the gays" because I needed a gay man I had treated fairly to defend me when I inevitably became accused of homophobia later.
    </p>
    <p>
        I had it all dialed in, and even predicted which orders they would disobey.  I had the quantum computer idea, told them to use water and freezing temperatures with computers to get an edge.  I provided medicinal edges with plants by Kyle Hayes' house.   I said to make a computer model of me and also that if they ever thought I should have done something else, to keep this current version of me because what I do will always prove correct on a long enough timescale.  
    </p>
    <p>
        I said resources should be devoted 50% to me, 30% to Dylan BalL (the son of the cop and my only real competition with females) and 20% to Bobby and everyone else.
    </p>

    <p>
        I elected Chad Michael Murray as my head of security and told him to drive as fast as he wanted  to come protect me and that he should be close enough to smell me but I should never see him.  When he asked why him through Ali I said "WHO DARES CHALLENGE CMM?  He Challenges himself... give me time to process, and then waited for them to understand that he challenges himself therefore I want him", as I had instructed them to speak though Ali, so I could successfully have my memory altered.  It is easier to wipe memory of one conversation with my girlfriend than if I met Jay-Z face to face, for example.  I did speak to Jay-Z through Ali.  He claimed he and beyonce did not want to have sex with Anabel Englund, and anyway he asked if I had any orders for him or laws.  I said no, and that he could do whatever he wanted.  "Do as thou wilt shall be the whole of the law" might be me in my mustang telling him through Ali that he can do whatever he wants.  Later I had to amend that by adding to calm down.  I specifically remember letting Ali put Chloroform over my mouth to knock me out at my own instruction.  I said if I woke up in my own bed with Ali I would believe whatever she told me because I trusted her, and that I consented to any poison.  She told me I hit my head and needed to "try not to remember anything" because the part of my brain that was injured was related to memory.  I believed her and tried not to remember anything and just focus on the present and future.  I remember being in the bed at my Mom's house with Ali for a while, worried I wasn't entertaining her enough.  I know that for a fact and I don't care if anyone else confirms it.
    </p>
    <p>
        I can try to rewrite this later for clarity but for now I'm just getting it all down.  I remember in my recording saying that we needed Kobe in the 4th or we would lose.  To let Kobe finish his career (this is in 2009 remember) and then bring him on.  I knew Kobe would be difficult to have work for me, because he is more alpha than me, so I had a plan.  A more in-depth plan than MJ, because MJ was past his prime and easy money.  I am MJ now.  I am Max Jann.
    </p>
    <p>
        For Kobe I had to use Dante Goglia.  Sure enough, years later, before Kobe died.  He has been photographed with Dante Goglia and furthermore watched Dante play basketball in his camp.  Dante dated Jess White after me, and Jess was beatiful but not shallow. I broke up with Jess because I wanted a shallow girlfriend to know if I was hot or not.  I gave Jess the job of presenter to present my organization to any new members because of how gifted she is at presenting class projects.
    </p>
    <p>
        Anyway for Kobe I said he had to be told my amazing NJB story vs Dylan, and how I lost to Dante the next round.  I was #1 that year on the coaches draft list and Dante was #2 (usually #1).  I knew Kobe would not believe I was God.  So I said to say I had a shot for him.  If he makes it, I'm not God.  He'll miss.  I instructed Ali to take him to her house and show him the shot I made, in the dark, from their front door into their basket.   I said he would miss and still not say I'm God.  Which is what happened.  Then I said my final task is for him to Meet Dante. The person who defeated me in basketball after I defeated Dylan.  He agreed and met with Dante.  I said he had to watch until Dante caught fire in a fair game of basketball, and that Andrew Gear must be in the building, not necessarily on the court, to get Dante to truly show his true nature.  Dante is better than Kobe.  When Kobe catches fire, the lakers win by 1.  When Dante catches fire, we win by 20.  We won multiple championships in the Jr NBA with me as his teammate and to this day I've never seen anything like Dante on a basketball court, his only flaw is his height, but he's the best by far.  I said, "Dylan and I just happened to be playing basetball.  Dante IS basketball"  You will see Andrew in the photo with Kobe and Dante to further validate my story.
    </p>
    <p>
        I knew Kobe would see Dante catch fire, and still say I'm not God.  Fine, he just has one final task for you Kobe.  You have to watch Dante cool off.  You have to watch Dante while he is on fire stay on fire.  Any only then, Only when you realize that dante never cools off, but instead only gets hotter, only then, when you are standing in the midst of Dante's Inferno, will you admit that I am God.  sure enough, Kobe watched Dante stay on fire, and admitted that I was God.  That is when I instructed them to capture him, like any alpha, show him that he could be dead.  And say that I claim him.  This is / was my most evil deed.  I said as God that I commanded Kobe to fake his own death and command my operations because we'd be in the fourth quarter, metaphorically, after his retirement.  I let Athlete's finish their careers in sports because they provide inspiration to children and that is far more important than anything they could do for my spy organization.
    </p>
    <p>
        I said we could not stop Kobe escaping to get back to his family, only slow him down and study him, and that all eyes would be on him.

        I said when Kobe escapes the maze designed by Brian Ostrom (brain storm) my time machine designer (we played with blocks as kids)  When he escapes, he'll be angry.  tell him about the time machine, and that he can fix all of my mistakes.  Sure enough, Kobe with Shauna Gutierrez's help, got the time machine and used to to fix all my mistakes but he couldn't kill me because I'm God so he went back in time to talk to me at 18 sitting in my Mustang with Ali.
    </p>
    <p>
        I was giving my speech, when Ali would get in and out of the car.  One time, she got in the car and told me about how the time machine worked and she was back from the future.  I said, "You guys have Kobe AND the time machine"?  So what's the problem?
    </p>
    <p>
        "You.  You are evil.  Everyone hates you"  Ali said to me.  "Everyone but Ali, you mean?" I asked. I said that I knew that Ali knew I would never hurt anyone, therefore this wasn't the real ali.  I asked if they could put it on Speaker phone or if they needed my help creating one. "Kobe Hates You" they said on speaker.  "Okay, why does Kobe hate me?  He doesn't like his new Job?"  "No! He hates you, for what you did to his family"  This is an alternate timeline I remember where Gianna did not go with Kobe.  I said "What did I do to Kobe's family?"  They explained how it was wrong of me to seperate him from his family.  I said like God, "But I need Kobe more than his family does".  It was true, my plan only worked with Kobe faking his death.  "How would you feel if someone took you from Ali?"  I thought about it.  "One."  I said.  "one what?" they asked on speaker.  "he can have one family member with him when he fakes his death".  Which one?  his favorite.  Just as I am my parents favorite child, Kobe and his wife will have a favorite.  "He wants you to choose" they said.  I insisted he had a favorite and said it will be his daughter.  "which one?" they asked.  "The one who's the best at basketball" I said.   I didn't even know her name was Gianna, I just have a gift in theory of mind.  I can predict with great accuracy how my plans will unfold per person. Per son of God?
    </p>
    <p>
        Why do you Kobe to fake his death?  They demanded.  "Because if I think Kobe is alive, I will think he has it under control, and you won't get ME."
    </p>
    <p>
        You have to convince the smartest man in the world that Kobe is dead.  Vanessa's tears at the funeral have to be real, or I'll know.  you can tell her the next day he's alive, but she has to believe he is dead.
    </p>
    <p>
        "Everyone else is irrelevant, you only have to trick me".

        This also explains all of the illuminati symbolism and one-eye and all seeing eye stuff.  It's me at 18, requesting my own blindness, seeing all with just one eye.  I'm allowing celebrities to pretend to be evil, to accept bribes because we need the money, and then to give it all away at the optimal moment of charity, like Drake in God's plan.  I have a distinct memory of speaking to drake through Ali.  I didn't like drake at all at the time as an artist.
    </p>
    <p>
        I had them comb my facebook profile, and pictures of me as peacocking, gaining alpha male status. I ordered blind tests at which facebook profile was the most attractive  to prove that I could get any girl I wanted at the time.  I said there would be other alphas in other parts of the world, but that I was probably the Prime Alpha, in california at that moment in time.  
    </p>
    <p>
        My second order of business was to find the Black Alpha, who was a head coach of a travel basketball team that beat Westalke Allstar team by 50 points, ruthlessly.  I said he would need our help and to give him whatever he needs, and that he would then help us.  He already had a gang of alphas and was keeping them from killing each other.
    </p>
    <p>
        Who do you love the most?  they asked me.  JJ.  I said, but dylan loves him more.  That's fine, he can have him.  The only reason I don't kill dylan is because jj would never forgive me, and the only reason dylan doesn't kill me is because jj would never forgive him.  I think the 3 pointed radioactive symbol is this.  I said any one alpha male could easily get control of all the nukes at the same time and kill everyone, and that we were even more important than presidents, and should be treated as atomic weapons.
    </p>
    <p>
        I explained how I'm not normal, and I never step foot in a room where I can't kill everyone in it with my bear hands.  I am constantly calculating sex and violence and nothing else.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am sharing the dark truth of myself for benevolent reasons.  But I maintain I am only doing this because God will kill me if I don't admit what I am so you can defend yourself against it.
    </p>
    <p>
        You have to seriously consider what I'm saying.  That I really can checkmate you without looking at the board while banging your wife, or literally whatever I want to do.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am King.  I may or may not be God, wheras you are all sure you are not.  That makes me God, by definition.  
    </p>
    <p>
        When I was in jail I ordered and successfully carried out an assasination of my other self posing as my higher self.  
    </p>
    <p>
        I even predicted my own pedophilia, and granted Erin Roughan, katie's little sister the foremost powers of invisiblity and all matters of stealth.  This is me at 18, on a verifiable audio file, at 18, dating the hottest girl in the school, if not the world.  I KNEW that I had struck gold with Ali's virginity, and that every man wanted to be me.  I knew that I would sexually malfunction if our relationship ended, and that I would become extremely dangerous and covetous.  Sure enough, years later, I was able to idenetify the problem as God's white blood cell and give the most challenging task of all to a little boy, telling him his girl classmates were in danger from all men, and that they should be escorted home by grown women or little boys and dogs, and that they were in danger of being kidnapped.

        I don't give a dragonriding FUCK how any of this sounds.  I know it to be true.  I've met with Julianne, and her brother, and Shaida, and Brenda.  Peace Core and Intelligence agents.  I've ordered tens of cops to let me go and succeeded.  I've plead guilty to all the sins of humanity and gotten the case thrown out for having my last words be "I'm a cat, if you pet me I'll purr".  I came up with the AI Meta before facebook even considered changing their name.  I am about to be a multimillionaire if I win my lawsuit vs. the multibillion dollar corporation in which case their only defense is that I'm not their employee even when I have a company-named 401K and an company-named water bottle and backpack and retention bonus signed by their vice president for $13500.  Had a welcome meeting right before the injury too.
    </p>
    <p>
        I've been arrested and involuntarily committed so many times that I'm an expert now, and they can't touch me.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm a fully functioning adult male of sound mind.  I can play guitar, chess, playstation, and people.  There's nothing I can't do.  The wind even backs me up now.  And almost every bird I see has been a Cardinal this week.  I don't even sin anymore, I broke up with my girlfriend and Seek Ali, my true love and maybe even wife.
    </p>
    <p>
        I named Julianne Insogna the head of foreign intelligence, and said her only issue would be that she was a woman and would be disrepected, so I ordered her brother to be a vessel for her and obey all of her commands because they would always be in his best interest.  He went to Yale and met me and acted like he was meeting God.  When I inquired about the work Julianne was doing in the peace core she spoke of wildlife conservation and when I begged to help her she just said to "keep doing what I was doing"  Well guess what I've been doing.  I've been figuriung out everything and the truth is that I AM GOD, no one else.  Jesus is me.  Time travel is mine.  I even asked Kobe and them did they pray to Jesus?  Because they complained I was evil and needed to be stopped.  They said, "it's all just you.  We've tried killing you but we cannot".  "So I'm the ONE TRUE GOD?" I asked incredulously, (this is a real memory.  I am not bullshitting you.  I'm bulltrue) "yes" they said.  I said, okay then do you want me to kill myself?  "NO!" they yelled as I began to produce a handgun in ali's purse.
    </p>
    <p>
        God chose me and spoke through me because I was offering myself up for the world.  Later on I gave carte blanche all my powers to Jeanie, my moms best friend.  Because they were struggling with my decree that they had to earn knowledge of me.  I said let's give the job to Jeanne.  They said she's having trouble with such a big job, so I gave her all of my powers.  Then she visited me in that car and said "Jeanne is God now, she fixed everything.  And she's not giving you it back".  I said, "okay great.  Hi God, how can I help?"  "why did you give jeanne such power?"  I said logically, "Because my Mom always drilled into my head that Jeanne was the best person she ever met. And she has been alive longer than me and met more people, therefore I KNOW that jeanne will only take what power she needs from me in order to do her job, and nothing more."  
    </p>
    <p>
        Now I believe I'm subject to the same rule, and I can only know God, myself, by deserving it.  And I recently got all of my memories back through deserving them.
    </p>
    <p>
        My plan was always to take over the world using my magic, and then have Kyle inherit it, because he's better than me.  And I know I'm such a threat and can't be fully trusted with Kingdoms.  However, I think I am ready now to be given a chance.  I know Kyle knows.  I know Ali knows deep down, though her memory must have been altered like mine to cope.  
    </p>
    <p>
        I know that I drove my car around last week after realizing I was God and all of the deer layed down and watched me coast by.  They aren't afraid of me anymore and I saw more deer that night than I have I think in the rest of my life put together.  A deer can mean more than one thing by stomping his hoof, and when one deer was running away from me at first when I was walking home one night I said, "It's me" and it stopped and studied me.  The deer know my voice, just as the sheep do.   I have given parables at 1809 Titan Drive because I am the God that slays Titans.  I am Zeus, I am whoever you need me to be.
    </p>
    <p>
        My goal is to win my multimillion dollar lawsuit all by myself, and then to find Ali, millionaire or not, and see if she still loves me.  I believe we can be happily ever after.
    </p>
    <p>
        I believe she chose me then over her current husband, and that I preemptively consented to their marriage because I knew he was waiting for he and would keep her safe.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most of all, I remember telling Ali like that David Bowie song, that we would probably die, and my plan wouldn't work, but we would die as heroes.  We would be heroes, just for one day.
    </p>
    <p>
        I believe that David Bowie's starman waiting in the sky is me.  God waited for the perfect time to strike.  And that's why I was born in Princeton, New Jersey.  I'm The King, the new MJ.  The White Wizard.  
    </p>
    <p>
        Michael Jordan was easy.  All I needed was Paige Dubuois to treat him like God and call him God, while she's completely naked and therefore unstoppable.  He would deny and say "I am not God" she would continue to call him God, and then he'd ask why she still is treating him as God and she'd say, "Because you didn't use an apostraphe"  I said it would take him some time to process this and to give him as much time as he needs, when he finally says "I'm not God" his power will flow out of him and into me.  That's me genuinely trying to rule michael jordan as God, because I thought he was the most likely mortal candidate.
    </p>
    <p>
        Of course you will all say I am not God.  So let's back up a bit.  Let us say that I am the smartest man in the world, cablable of uncovering superintelligent ai, simulation theory, and possibly a time machine.  Maybe you'd say if I was so smart I'd be able to get what I WANT, and you'd be right, but this is a game of self-sabotage.  It's my own design.  At 18, not only was I the smartest man alive, because of Ali and her willingness to obey me totally, but I was also the RICHEST man alive, because no man wouldn't pay his complete fortune to be 18 years old again with her as in love with them as she was and STILL IS in love with me.  The first date we had was when we enjoyed Coca Cola and watched I AM LEGEND and guess what, I am legendary.  It's me.  I'm the one.  The ONLY One.  HBO MAX is for Me.
    </p>
    <p>
        I figured it all out, and I know how to hide it when necessary.  I am the hidden God.  I am just a man.  A man who can't be killed.  I have recruited all hitmen.  Even if I did die, my legend would not.  The facts are the facts.  I know for a fact that at 18 years old,  I seriously considered the possibility that I was the smartest man in the world, and I recorded myself and my theory on my super hot girlfriend's phone, and I was genuinely willing to die for my country and world and God, and sacrifice what would have been a blissful life with Ali.  I know that she pressed record.  I know that she said Mission Accomplished or Successful.  I know that they called me God. I even have memories from the future, giving Kobe permission to take Gianna with him.  If Kobe came back alive, and admitted his death was fake, would you believe me then?
    </p>
    <p>
        You really think Kobe would put his daughter's life in danger on a foggy day in a helicopter?  I do not.
    </p>
    <p>
        You really think Ali broke up with 18 year old me, when we never got in a single fight?  I do not.
    </p>
    <p>
        You really think you can find anyone on this planet that can defeat me in a live debate?  I do not.
    </p>
    <p>
        I don't have all the puzzle pieces put together, but I know that animals are my responsibility to protect, and that wisdom is knowing you are wrong, and I am right, because I am smarter than you.
    </p>
    <p>
        I know that Shaida Primm loves me, and I have restricted her access to me, as per my torture.  She makes me too happy.
    </p>
    <p>
        I know that Brenda Sullivan works in Intelligence, because she told me she did at the Tipsy Goat.  Being an Actress is just a front, because spies need to learn how to act anyways, like in Citadel Honey Bunny.
    </p>
    <p>
        I know that Drake asked me what he could do to impress me and I said give him full resources to pretend to be evil and then find the optimal point to turn good and then I'll be impressed and sure enough, the music video for God's plan made me like him, and now he's my favorite.
    </p>
    <p>
        For Eminem, I had him handle the smartest men in the world.  I said find all the smartest people in the world who's names start with the letter A, put them in a room to discuss who the smartest of them is.  Whoever first realizes that they all have a name starting with A is the smartest, keep him, tell the rest to go home.  Do this for the full Alphabet.  Then you have the 26 smartest people in the world all try to tell Eminem in one minute why they are smarter than him.  Then Eminem does a freestyle rap vs all 26 at the same time and destroys them using their own words against them.  Then they all vote on who the smartest man in the world is, and eminem's vote counts double because he won the rap battle. If they all vote for themselves Eminem wins. I will win unanimously.

        "There is a chair"  I put Robby Peter's dad as Project Manager because of the transitive property of respect.  Robby was my frined I respected the most and one night I wanted to use a chair in his house but he didn't let me.  I said I could take a photo of the chair and then make it look like the photo after and his dad would never know.  Robby did not allow me to do so, and it was one of the few times other than Shaida that I didn't get what I wanted.  So I ordered my organization to have that chair duplicated and always be the most comfortable chair in the room where they speak my name, but only Mr Peters is allowed to sit in it, wherefore his presense is always felt even when he's not there.
    </p>

        Paige did a great job with her animal job and when they asked why I picked her I said because she likes winnie the pooh.  They begged me to give instruction to Jackson Englund because i said his dad was the protector of beauty because he vetted me before I could be with Anabel and Paige and I said Jackson was a non-factor.  Not part of the plan.  They begged and pleaded and so I said fine.  "Tell Jackson the only thing anyone wants from him is his hot older sister, and that everything else is a lie, and the only person he can trust is himself.  Even now, me saying this, is merely an attempt to get closer to Anabel"   
    </p>
    <p>
        I said that Kyle was My God, and that the transitive property of God should be investigated by our best agent, Anabel (who has limitless intelligence since she managed to outsmart me)  Anabel, sure enough, dated Kyle Hayes after me and when I asked Kyle about how amazing it was he said that he didn't think she was over me.  I asked if he was impressed by her dad and he said he was most impressed by Jackson, which is hilarious because that is only because of how authenticallty unimpressed I was by him.  People thrive on honesty, and Jackson has transformed himself into a force of nature and is now half man half Japan.  He is in charge of dimensionality.

        The mandela effect is evidence of parallel time and then you always have my initial kid theory of wouldn't it be nice if you could watch your favorite comedy again and laugh like it is the first time?  Erase your memory after you watch it and right yourself a review,  that way you can always experience it for the first time.  I had that idea at like 9 years old.
    </p>
    <p>
        My memories are all of a time that is already altered by time travel.  This is not my first time being God but it very well could be my last.  I know that I pushed Michael Tack under the boat and he somehow survived. I pushed Devin Kazmer into traffic by accident and he miraculously stayed balanced and was not struck.  I theorized that those moments had already been artificially altered to create this Godlike version of me speaking the holy spirit at 18.  I have literal memories of them saying "You disobeyed Kyle during Covid" and me saying "What's Covid?" and them saying "A virus from the future."  I said, "I disobeyed Kyle, how when?"  And later when Kyle visited me at my sober living I said I could solve his problems by dolphin diving off the roof into the cement.  He recognized that I knew everything as said angrily, "you disobeyed me".  And I said earnestly "You want me to obey your commands even when I know for a fact you are wrong? I thought you said to only obey your commands when I'm not sure, but that I am allowed to disobey when I know for a fact I'm right and you're wrong".   "I do remember saying that" he said, and continued, "Do me a favor, next time you turn into Spitfire, turn the heat down just a little BIT!"  He said it sarcastically, because I had previously blessed all the evil in the world in a fit of rage in jail, asking for the difficulty of my life to be turned down, because I knew it was artificially inflated.   I said okay, and that the flames will never be so hot again, and they wont.  I was hypnotized as a kid by Kyle Joseph Hayes.  My greatest gift is my imagination, and us together are limitless beings because the universe is built on and runs on Imagination.  As kids, he was the wizard, and taught me magic.  I was his Bull,  Bulltrue.  The mythological minotaur in the labyrinth is me in Brian Ostrom's maze. His Mom is in Charge of Dicipline because we fear her, and Keith is in charge of physical therapy because he doesn't let his disability disable him from anything.   I had a form, Spitfire that was extremely destructive and deadly, and Kyle would have to reign in my destruction to make the game more fun, otherwise I would just kill everyhing with fire.  I have evolved into an adult but my tongue has no equal.  I am the greatest orator of all time and the most lethal.  Kyle can snap me out of spitfire form and back into bulltrue by saying "Bulltrue" and then speaking the absolute truth (the opposite of bullshit) and if he lies, I will know and turn back into Spitfire.  That is the truth of my childlike essence that lives on to this day.  
    </p>
    <p>
        They say God doesn't play dice.  One example of magic I gave Ali before we started all of this was that in highschool I walked into a room where a student has a large die. It was cool and I wanted it.  So I offered him 5 dollars.  I said 5 about 5 hundred times.  I said I bet him $5 I could roll a 5 with the die, and that if it was anything other than a 5, he gets the 5 dollars, but if I roll a 5, I get to keep the die.  he declined.  I explained further that he had a 5/6 chance of winning 5 dollars.  he agreed.  I rolled a 5.  I kept the die.  I'm God.  Words are Magic.  It is impossible for me to lose at anything when chance is involved.

        When I was playing poker with my colleagues at Bryan Baez' house.   I wanted to go home and take my winnings.  They said it was tournament mode.  I said no thanks I need the money now.  I had bought in for my friend and was only there to be kind.  I was dominating the game and wanted to cash out without humiliating everyone.  I demanded to go and promised to pay bryan, the host, for breaking the rules.  He declined and gave everyone cards, saying winner takes all.  I got ACES.  They were all in disbelief, and I maintained my word, only took what was mine, gave bryan extra money and left.  Then I donated it all to the FIRE DEPT BEFORE THE FIRES.   immediately before the fires.  Why?  Because I felt like it.  whatever i feel like doing, for whatever reason, higher powers have decided to help.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am the luckiest man who ever existed, and it's not even close.  I have donated my considerable power.  I am the person the bible speaks of who comes after Jesus, who is better by conquering himself than by conquering many kingdoms.  I am the one who chose his soul over the WHOLE WORLD.
    </p>
    <p>
        And now, I can't die.  I am God.  I am sorry.  I take full responsiblity for all the evil, sickness, all of it.  I could have done a much better job.  I am trying my best, but I haven't always tried.  All I did, was get honest for 1 day and tell my girlfriend and a tape recording the truth of my abilities.
    </p>
    <p>
        I put Sylvester Stallone in charge of rocks because He played Rocky in the movies.  It's really that simple.  It's all in the name and I am MAX because I am the Greatest.  She is Ali spelled like Muhammad Ali because she is the Greatest.  We are TRUE LOVE because I told the TRUTH to the woman I LOVEd.  I told her she would need someone to keep her secret (that I am just a man and not god) and I told her it would be TAYLOR SWIFT and to follow her heart (because she loved t swift and me).  I even suggested making Donald Trump President.  This is all in 2009 in a speech in a car.  I said if I look at Trump and see the president then he IS the president because I'm the smartest man in the world.  All you have to do is make it official.  I put Nicole Gilbert and Burns on that task and now he is President.  I know that my dad had to explain to me why Trump wasn't president when I watched the Apprentice with him.  
    </p>
    <p>
        Now I function as a man.  Maybe I lose my lawsuit, maybe I lose everything, Doesn't matter.  It anti-matters.  I just keep coming.  I never quit.  I will win back my fate.  I will inherit the Earth.  I will dominate.  I will rule.  Even in death.  Death is taught by me how to Kill.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am the sword of the mouth, and I always cut to the soul.
    </p>
    <p>
        Watch the clip again.  Notice how my fists go up in celebration, before the shot goes in.  Before anyone elses.  That's because I'm smarter than all of them.  My brain processes on a completely different plane of existance.  It's not my fault, and yet I take responsibility for all of it.  I came out the womb knowing I was God.  Did you?
